The announcement came just hours after the institution refused to comply with a list of demands made by the Trump administration, which the university's president said would have undermined its academic freedom. In a letter sent to Harvard on Friday, the federal government called for sweeping reforms in governance and leadership at the university. Among other demands, it also sought to end all diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) programmes at Harvard. The federal government stated that nearly $9bn (€7.9bn) in grants and contracts were at risk if Harvard failed to comply. On Monday, Harvard President Alan Garber said the institution would not yield to the government. “The university will not sacrifice its independence or abandon its constitutional rights,” Garber wrote in a letter to the Harvard community. “No government — regardless of which party holds power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and employ, or the fields of study and inquiry they may pursue,"" he said. Since starting his second term in January, US President Donald Trump has aggressively targeted some of the country's top universities over what he and his allies see as their fostering of left-wing beliefs. The administration has also argued that universities like Harvard have allowed antisemitism to persist unchecked during campus protests opposing Israel’s war in Gaza last year. As part of its university crackdown, the Trump administration has normalised the withholding of federal funds to pressure major academic institutions into accepting its terms. Columbia, one of the universities targeted by the government, had $400m in funding frozen. It agreed last month to several of the terms demanded by the Trump administration. The former US President Barack Obama urged universities to follow Harvard's example in fighting back against the federal government's attacks. ""Harvard has set an example for other higher-ed institutions – rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom, while taking concrete steps to make sure all students at Harvard can benefit from an environment of intellectual inquiry, rigorous debate and mutual respect,"" he wrote on social media. ""Let’s hope other institutions follow suit,"" he added."

The company said it would stop studying the experimental drug, danuglipron, after a participant in one of its clinical trials experienced a possible drug-induced liver injury that ended once the person stopped taking the treatment. The once-daily version of the pill was in early-stage testing, with researchers trying to figure out the best dose for patients, a spokeswoman said. The company intended to move the drug into late-stage testing, which is generally the last and most expensive phase before a company submits its potential new treatment to government regulators for approval. A company official said in a statement that Pfizer still plans to develop other potential obesity treatments in earlier stages of testing. Obesity treatments have become one of the more promising and lucrative sectors of drug development for pharmaceutical companies. Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, for instance, brought in nearly $5 billion (€4.6 billion) in sales in 2024, its first full year on the market. But leading treatments like Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy are injectable. Drugmakers are eager to develop an easier-to-take pill version for patients who don't want to deal with needles and daily injections. Lilly researchers expect to see data this year from studies of a couple of potential oral treatments it has developed. While the drugs have become top-sellers, many patients have had a hard time getting them either due to recent shortages or patchy insurance coverage. Both Lilly and Novo have recently announced price cuts, but the treatments can still cost hundreds of euros per month, putting them out of reach for some people without coverage. Pfizer said in late 2023 that it would abandon a twice-daily version of danuglipron that had advanced to mid-stage testing after more than half the patients in a clinical trial stopped taking it. A company spokeswoman said the decision meant Pfizer would also stop testing danuglipron in combination with other drugs to treat obesity."

The talks in Doha are meant to take place later this week or next, the official said. The proposed ceasefire deal would allow for the entry of food and shelter into Gaza, on which Israel has imposed a blockade for over one month. However, the Hamas official said a major sticking point remained over whether the war would end as part of any new deal. The war started on 7 October 2023, when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, during the attack on southern Israel and took 251 people captive. Some have since been freed in ceasefire agreements and other deals. Fifty-nine remain in Gaza, 24 of whom are believed to be still alive. Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in January that lasted eight weeks before Israel resumed the war last month. The initial ceasefire agreement was meant to bring the sides toward negotiating an end to the war. Israel, however, wants to defeat Hamas first. A senior Hamas official told Al Jazeera that the proposal they received from Egypt includes a clause calling for their disarmament, something they firmly rejected. He reportedly added that disarmament ""is not just a red line. It is a million red lines."" The official further emphasised that Hamas wants a permanent ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza to be central to the deal. Officials from Israel and Qatar had no immediate comment. Since the ceasefire fell apart last month, Israel has blocked aid from entering Gaza and forces have also seized swaths of the coastal enclave in a bid to ratchet up pressure on Hamas to agree to a deal more aligned with Israel's terms. On Monday, the United Nations aid office warned that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is now likely to be “the worst” since Israel launched its war on Hamas in response to the militant group's 7 October attack. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters: “No fuel has come in, no food has come in, no medicine has come in.”"

If reading from Europe, you might have heard about it but not know the specifics, according to the first European survey of public attitudes towards quantum science and technology. The poll showed that most adults in France and Germany (78 per cent) are aware of quantum technology, and many also know about how it could tackle major societal challenges.  But only one third of respondents had a good level of understanding about what quantum is, and 49 per cent had heard of it but didn’t know what it is. Quantum science is the study of quantum particles, which are the fundamental building blocks of matter and energy that operate according to quantum mechanics rather than classical physics. These particles are key to technologies such as GPS, semiconductors, and MRI scanners. They cannot be seen even with a traditional optical microscope, like electrons, protons, or individual atoms. The study, conducted by YouGov was released to coincide with World Quantum Day on Monday and the United Nations’ International Year of Quantum Science and Technology.  This year also marks the 100 years since the initial development of quantum mechanics.  The survey also found that in total, 47 per cent of those surveyed said they believe quantum will have a positive impact on their country over the next five years. Almost half of respondents said they were optimistic about quantum’s impact on health, energy, cybersecurity, and climate change. Quantum could help in areas such as healthcare by delivering precise medical imaging through quantum sensors, and speed up drug discoveries by simulating molecular interactions.  In combatting the effects of climate change, quantum physics allows scientists to develop next-generation sensors for environmental monitoring.  For security, quantum encryption can protect communications, while quantum computers could solve previously intractable problems that standard computers cannot. In November last year, the EU’s technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen said quantum technology was a field in which Europe should be optimistic and mapped out a quantum strategy, which includes the development of a European quantum chip and a possible Quantum Act. The EU also called for €65 million of funding to accelerate the industrialisation of quantum chips last year, which came as part of a broader €200 million investment across three years within the EU Chips Act. The EU is not the only place that is betting big on quantum.  To mark World Quantum Day, the United Kingdom also announced a £121 million (€140 million) investment in quantum technology for societal issues, which included fighting fraud and money laundering.  However, despite European Nobel laureate Anton Zeilinger laying the groundwork for quantum, Europe lags behind China and the US when it comes to quantum technology as it lacks the necessary infrastructure, deployment, and investment.  “Europe suffers from very limited private investments in quantum technologies vis-à-vis other geo-blocks,” Mario Draghi said in his report on the future of European competitiveness, adding that the EU should develop an internationally competitive ecosystem."
5444af26-5fed-4ba6-852d-50ea3b445ee4,https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/04/15/millions-of-people-are-tuning-in-to-watch-a-24-hour-livestream-of-moose-migrating-in-swede,15.04.2025 09:59 GMT+1,Millions of people are tuning in to watch a 24-hour livestream of moose migrating in Sweden,"Before Swedish slow TV hit “The Great Moose Migration” began airing Tuesday, Ulla Malmgren stocked up on coffee and prepared meals. She doesn't want to miss a moment of the 20-day, 24-hour event. “Sleep? Forget it. I don’t sleep,” she said. Malmgren, 62, isn't alone. The show, called “ Den stora älgvandringen ” in Swedish and sometimes translated as “The Great Elk Trek” in English, began in 2019 with nearly a million people watching. In 2024, the production hit 9 million viewers on SVT Play, the streaming platform for national broadcaster SVT. The livestream kicked off a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement. Malmgren was ready. From now until 4 May, the livestream's remote cameras will capture dozens of moose as they swim across the Ångerman River, some 300 kilometers northwest of Stockholm, in the annual spring migration toward summer grazing pastures. Not much happens for hours at a time, and fans say that's the beauty of it. “I feel relaxed, but at the same time I’m like, ‘Oh, there’s a moose, oh! What if there’s a moose? I can’t go to the toilet!’” said William Garp Liljefors, 20, who has collected more than 150 moose plush toys since 2020. “The Great Moose Migration"" is part of a trend that began in 2009 with Norwegian public broadcaster NRK's minute-by-minute airing of a seven-hour train trip across the southern part of the country. The slow TV style of programming has spread, with productions in the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere. The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a “ fish doorbell ” on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds. Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at Jönköping University in Sweden, said slow TV has roots in reality television but lacks the staging and therefore feels more authentic for viewers. The productions allow the audience to relax and watch the journey unfold. “It became, in a strange way, gripping because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,"" she said. ""But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.” As an expert and a fan of “The Great Moose Migration,” Hill said the livestream helps her slow down her day by following the natural rhythms of spring. “This is definitely a moment to have a calm, atmospheric setting in my own home, and I really appreciate it,” she said. The calming effect extends to the crew, according to Johan Erhag, SVT's project manager for “The Great Moose Migration.” “Everyone who works with it goes down in their normal stress,” he said. The moose have walked the route for thousands of years, making it easy for the crew to know where to lay some 20,000 metres of cable and position 26 remote cameras and seven night cameras. A drone is also used to capture shots of the animals. The crew of up to 15 people works out of SVT’s control room in Umeå, producing the show at a distance to avoid interfering with the migration. SVT won't say how much the production costs, but Erhag said it's cheap when accounting for the 506 hours of footage aired last year. Erhag said Swedes have always been fascinated by the roughly 300,000 moose roaming in their woods. The Scandinavian country's largest animal is known as “King of the Forest.” A bull moose can reach 210 centimetres at shoulder height and weigh 450 kilograms. Despite their size, these herbivores are typically shy and solitary. “We actually don’t see it very often. You often see it when you’re out driving maybe once or twice in your life,” Erhag said. “I think that’s one thing why it has been so, so popular. And then you bring in the nature to everyone’s living room."" Hanna Sandberg, 36, first began watching the show in 2019, though she didn't spot any moose. She tuned in the following year, finally saw some and got hooked. “You can watch them and be a part of their natural habitat in a way that you could never be otherwise,” she said. After hours of showing an empty forest, a camera captures footage of a moose approaching the riverbank. Suddenly, slow TV turns urgent. The push alert hits SVT's app - “Första älgarna i bild!” which translates to “First moose on camera!” - as viewers worldwide tune in. The livestream's chat explodes as commenters type encouragement for the animal, now making its way into the water. ”I would actually like to be a little fly on the wall in every household that watches the moose migration. Because I think there is about a million people saying about the same thing: ‘Go on! Yes, you can do it!’"" Malmgren said. Mega-fans like Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, are committed to watching as many hours as possible. “I was late to school because I saw moose and my teacher was like, ‘What, you saw moose in the city?’ And I was like, ‘No, it’s on the TV,’” Garp Liljefors said. Malmgren said friends and family have learned not to bother her when the moose are on the move. “When someone asks me, ‘What are you doing? Oh, never mind, it’s the great migration,’"" she said. ""They know.”"

Five years later, that landmark #MeToo verdict is gone - wiped away on appeal - and Weinstein is set to go on trial again, beginning today with jury selection. New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, overturned Weinstein’s conviction and ordered a new trial, finding that his original one in 2020 was tainted by improper rulings and prejudicial testimony. That ruling gave Weinstein a second chance to fight the charges, and do so in a different atmosphere than his first trial, which was held in the middle of a global reckoning over sexual misconduct. Weinstein, 73, who has pleaded not guilty and denies that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone, is older and more frail, in and out of the hospital regularly for a variety of health problems. He's now far removed from the time when he was among the most powerful men in the movie business. In the New York retrial, Judge Curtis Farber has set aside at least four days for jury selection and expects opening statements and the start of testimony next week. The judge, prosecution and defense will work to whittle a massive pool of potential jurors down to the 18 people - 12 jurors and six alternates - needed for the trial by asking questions and seeking to eliminate anyone they feel can’t judge the case fairly. Weinstein is being retried on two charges from his original trial. He is accused of raping aspiring actress Jessica Mann in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performing a criminal sex act by forcing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant Mimi Haley in 2006. He is also charged with one count of criminal sex act based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the original trial. That woman, who has not been named publicly, alleges Weinstein forced oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel.  Even if the retrial ends in not guilty verdicts, Weinstein will remain behind bars at Rikers Island, as he was sentenced for a second time in February 2023 after being convicted of raping an actress in a Los Angeles hotel room in 2013. He was also found guilty of forcible oral copulation and sexual penetration by a foreign object in relation to the same woman, named only in court as Jane Doe 1. Weinstein is also appealing the Los Angeles rape conviction. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, though his lawyers said he needs to be resentenced because the since-vacated New York conviction was a factor in how his punishment was calculated.

The average 80-year-old has witnessed an extraordinary boom in personal technology throughout their lifetime: born years before colour television, they’re growing old in the TikTok era.  For years, scientists have fretted over whether the ubiquity of tech in daily life harms or helps our minds as we age. The research, published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, is the latest to tip the scales toward the “help” category. It pooled data from 57 studies spanning more than 411,000 adults aged 50 and older from around the world, all of whom had either a cognitive diagnosis or testing. The researchers called these older adults, aged 68 on average, “digital pioneers” because they didn’t have access to the Internet during childhood. Older people who used smartphones, computers, or the Internet had a lower risk of cognitive impairment than those who stayed away from devices, the analysis shows. Over several years of follow-up, tech-savvy seniors were also less likely to experience cognitive decline. The link between tech use and brain health was as strong – or stronger – than other factors that seem to protect against dementia, including lower blood pressure, exercise, being more highly educated, and having mentally stimulating hobbies. The findings are “completely timely” given countries around the world are ageing, Maximilian Haas, who leads a research group on technology and cognitive function at the University of Geneva, told Euronews Health. And “it’s understandable that technology use could evoke and provoke comparable effects compared to these other factors,” added Haas, who was not involved with the new study. Notably, the new study’s results held up even when the researchers accounted for issues like socioeconomic status, overall health, and social support, which could also boost brain health. The findings are in line with a study Haas published last year, which found that older adults in Switzerland who had stronger memories were more likely to be regular Internet users. Meanwhile another analysis of about 463,000 people in the United Kingdom concluded that there is no “obvious association” between computer use and dementia, though more research is needed to disentangle the potential impact of too much screen time on brain health. These studies favour the idea that our digital lives could promote more complex thinking, skills, and social connections, net positives for brain health. The benefits, referred to as “technological reserve”, are often contrasted with the “digital dementia” theory, which argues that an over-reliance on technology decimates memory, attention, and problem-solving abilities, particularly among younger people. But in reality, “there’s both positive and negative sides to screen exposure,” Haas said, adding that moderation is key. When it comes to cognitive function, “it’s too little or too much that makes the difference here”."

In December the European Commission concluded a political agreement with the Mercosur countries - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay - to establish one of the world's biggest free trade zones, encompassing 750 million people and about one-fifth of the global economy. The agreement now needs approval from EU countries before it enters into force. France has long been opposed to the agreement. In particular, it denounced what it claimed would result in unfair competition for its farmers, calling for so-called “mirror clauses” to be introduced in the deal, so that agricultural imports coming from the Mercosur meet the same production standards existing for EU farmers. MEP Marie-Pierre Vedrenne (France/Renew), a prominent critic of the Mercosur agreement during the previous legislative term and former chair of the Trade Committee, has adopted a more measured tone recently. “I do hold a personal conviction: remaining opposed to this agreement on principle alone doesn’t seem reasonable to me,” she told Euronews. Officially, France maintains that it is mindful of the evolving global trade context, but its position on the Mercosur agreement remains unchanged. Paris continues to reject the deal. “The French position has not changed, but the context has and we take it into account,” a French diplomat told Euronews, “The context is now in favour of the Mercosur agreement, and the Latin American countries are also looking for opportunities as the US market is closing. This must lead us to be ambitious in terms of protecting the environment and our farmers.” This stance was echoed by another French official. The imminent arrival of Friedrich Merz as Germany Chancellor, and renewed EU impetus to diversify global trade partnerships in response to rising US protectionism, has intensified pressure on France and other member states opposing the EU-Mercosur agreement. “The Mercosur free trade agreement with the four South American countries must come into force quickly,” Merz told German media Handelsblatt on 13 April. Among the countries opposed to the deal, Ireland, keen to protect its farmers, said on 9 April through its Minister for Trade that it would maintain its opposition, and Austria remains opposed, while the Netherlands and Poland are critics of the deal. Italy remains in favour of the agreement, though it wants impact on agriculture to be taken into account in the final text. On Monday, a Commission spokesperson said that the EU executive was not planning to make any changes to the text. The document that the member states will have to approve will be sent to them before the end of the summer, the Commission added. In the meantime, uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s ongoing tariff war leaves open the possibility that EU critics of the Mercosur deal may reconsider their stance."

As demand for radiopharmaceuticals grows steadily across Europe, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMA) issued a joint set of recommendations on Monday urging the EU to strengthen its supply chain by targeting critical vulnerabilities beyond production. Radiopharmaceuticals are medicines containing radioactive isotopes and are essential in diagnosing and treating conditions such as tumours. An example is the use of iodine for imaging and treating thyroid cancer. While safe for medical use, their radioactive nature makes both production and transport uniquely complex and highly regulated. The EMA warns that the EU’s current supply chain is not only constrained by limited manufacturing capacity, but also hampered by fragmented transport regulations and a heavy reliance on third countries for key raw materials. A call to ensure the supply of medical radioisotopes was highlighted by EU-27 energy ministers last June. A major concern is the EU’s dependence on High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU), a specialised fuel used in reactors that produce medical isotopes. Currently, Russia is the only commercial supplier capable of delivering HALEU at scale through its state-owned company Tenex. The US, while not yet a major supplier, began producing HALEU domestically in October 2023 for the first time in more than 70 years. Additionally, French nuclear fuel company Orano is exploring the possibility of building a uranium enrichment facility in the US to reduce Washington’s reliance on Russian imports. To address these dependencies, the EMA recommends developing EU-based HALEU enrichment capabilities and investing in long-term solutions. The EU's agency also supports initiatives like the European Radioisotope Valley Initiative (ERVI), which aims to boost domestic production of medical radionuclides, and SAMIRA (Strategic Agenda for Medical Applications of Ionising Radiation), part of the EU’s Beating Cancer Plan. EU countries are encouraged to map their entire radiopharmaceutical supply chains, from raw material sourcing to final delivery, and explore national strategies aligned with a broader EU framework. The EMA’s recommendations come as the EU reassesses the strategic value of medical radioisotopes, recognising their importance not just for public health but also for geopolitical resilience and health sovereignty. While expanding production remains important, the EMA emphasises that addressing transport bottlenecks is equally critical. The agency points to regulatory inconsistencies between member states and outdated infrastructure as key barriers to efficient delivery. Transporting radiopharmaceuticals requires highly specialised containers, strict timing, and coordination across a patchwork of national regulations. All these factors can delay the delivery of time-sensitive, life-saving treatments. Among its proposed solutions, the EMA calls for EU-wide certification standards for transport containers and mutual recognition of certifications among member states. Without such harmonisation, delays and inefficiencies could intensify as demand continues to rise. One looming challenge is the EU’s move to ban lead in transport containers. Lead, commonly used to shield radioactive materials, poses significant environmental and health risks. While the EU has already banned lead shot in wetlands, broader restrictions are being considered, potentially affecting the radiopharmaceutical supply chain. However, the EMA stresses the Commission to consider the potential challenges and consequences for the sector in case of a ban of lead."

His comments followed the decision to temporarily exempt electronic products from duties, marking a further step back from the sweeping trade tariffs announced earlier this month. “I’m looking for something to help some of the car companies, where they’re switching to parts that were made in Canada, Mexico and other places, and they need a little bit of time because they’re going to make them here,” he said at the Oval Office on Monday. The Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on automobile imports on 3 April. Bloomberg previously reported that major carmakers, including Ford Motor, General Motors, and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV, were lobbying for exemptions on certain low-cost car components, as these could face additional taxes on top of the full 25% auto tariffs if sourced from outside the US. Meanwhile, the US Department of Commerce released a notice stating it had initiated investigations into the semiconductor and pharmaceutical trades. Both probes fall under Section 232 of the National Security Investigation framework, signalling the potential for further tariffs on the two sectors and adding to the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariff agenda. These investigation notices came after Trump stated that exemptions on electronic products would be temporary and emphasised that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances” on Sunday. The semiconductor investigation document noted that it aims to “determine the effects on the national security of imports of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME), and their derivative products”. The pharmaceutical probe will examine imports of “finished drug products, medical countermeasures, critical inputs such as active pharmaceutical ingredients, and key starting materials, and derivative products of those items”. European markets opened slightly higher after Trump’s comments suggesting possible relief on auto tariffs. As of around 9.30am CEST, stocks were broadly positive, with Germany’s DAX up 0.9%, the UK’s FTSE 100 gaining 0.7%, and the STOXX 600 up 0.6%. The CAC 40 was down 3%. European automakers’ shares may benefit from the shift in US policy following a bruising sell-off over the past month. Notably, shares in Germany’s major car manufacturers—Volkswagen (VW), BMW, Porsche, and Mercedes-Benz—have each fallen between 15% and 18% during that period. On Tuesday morning, VW shares were up 3.7%, BMW showed a 3.8% jump, Porsche rose 2%, while shares in Mercedes-Benz leapt 3.8%. However, Europe’s technology and pharmaceutical stocks could face renewed pressure due to the US probes into the semiconductor and drug sectors. In particular, Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk may face heightened scrutiny, as the US is its largest single market for its weight-loss drug. The firm suffered its worst monthly decline in March after a series of disappointing trial results. Investor concerns have also been stoked by Trump’s tariff threat on pharmaceutical products, which could erode profit margins. Among tech stocks, ASML—Europe’s largest chip equipment manufacturer—will be in the spotlight ahead of its earnings results on Wednesday. Shares in ASML rose 2.8% on Tuesday morning. In currencies, the euro held steady above 1.13 during Tuesday’s Asian session, hovering at its strongest level since 2022. The euro has been seen as a haven asset amid Trump’s tariff-driven trade shocks, which have triggered broader risk-off sentiment in global markets over the past month. The EUR/USD pair surged above 1.14 at one point on Monday and is likely to maintain its uptrend on continued economic uncertainty. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to deliver its third consecutive interest rate cut on Thursday, reinforcing the Eurozone’s accommodative stance amid ongoing risks.

The Republican president said automakers needed time to relocate production from Canada, Mexico and other places, ""And they need a little bit of time because they’re going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time. So I’m talking about things like that.” Matt Blunt, president of American Automotive Policy Council, an association representing Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, said the group shared Trump's goals of increased domestic production. “There is increasing awareness that broad tariffs on parts could undermine our shared goal of building a thriving and growing American auto industry, and that many of these supply chain transitions will take time,"" Blunt said. Trump's statement hinted at yet another round of reversals on tariffs as Trump's onslaught of import taxes has panicked financial markets and raised deep concerns from Wall Street economists about a possible recession. When Trump announced the 25% auto tariffs on March 27, he described them as “permanent.” His hard lines on trade have become increasingly blurred as he has sought to limit the possible economic and political blowback from his policies. Last week, after a bond market sell-off pushed up interest rates on US debt, Trump announced that for 90 days his broader tariffs against dozens of countries would instead be set at a baseline 10% to give time for negotiations. At the same time, Trump increased the import taxes on China to 145%, only to temporarily exempt electronics from some of those tariffs by having those goods charged at a 20% rate. “I don’t change my mind, but I’m flexible,” Trump said on Monday. Trump's flexibility has also fuelled a sense of uncertainty and confusion about his intentions and end goals. The S&P 500 stock index was up 0.8% Monday, but it's still down nearly 8% this year. Interest rates on 10-year US Treasury notes were elevated at roughly 4.4%. Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for the Northern Trust global financial firm, said the whiplash had been so great that he might have to “get fitted for a neck brace.” Tannenbaum warned in an analysis: “Damage to consumer, business, and market confidence may already be irreversible.” Maroš Šefčovič, the European commissioner for trade and economic security, posted on X on Monday that on behalf of the European Union he engaged in trade negotiations with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. ""The EU remains constructive and ready for a fair deal — including reciprocity through our 0-for-0 tariff offer on industrial goods and the work on non-tariff barriers,"" Šefčovič said. The US president also said that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook and “helped” him recently. Many Apple products, including its popular iPhone, are assembled in China. Apple didn’t respond to a Monday request for comment about the latest swings in the Trump administration’s tariff pendulum. Even if the exemptions granted on electronics last week turn out to be short-lived, the temporary reprieve gives Apple some breathing room to figure out ways to minimise the trade war’s impact on its iPhone sales in the US. That prospect helped lift Apple’s stock price 2% on Monday. Still, the stock gave up some of its earlier 7% increase as investors processed the possibility that the iPhone could still be jolted by more tariffs on Chinese-made products in the weeks ahead. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Apple is clearly in a far better position than it was a week ago, but he warned there's still “mass uncertainty, chaos, and confusion about the next steps ahead.” One possible workaround Apple may be examining during the current tariff reprieve is how to shift even more of its iPhone production from its longtime hubs in China to India, where it began expanding its manufacturing while Trump waged a trade war during his first term as president. The Trump administration has suggested that its tariffs had isolated China as the US engaged in talks with other countries. But China is also seeking to build tighter relationships in Asia with nations stung by Trump's tariffs. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, on Monday met in Hanoi with Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary To Lam with the message that no one wins in trade wars. Asked about the meeting, Trump suggested the two nations were conspiring to do economic harm to the US by “trying to figure out how do we screw the United States of America.”"

The latest European State of the Climate report from the EU’s Copernicus service (C3S) shows that 45 per cent of days were much warmer than average, and 12 per cent were the warmest on record.  More than 100 scientific experts came together to demonstrate that the impacts of climate change in Europe - which is warming twice as fast as the global average - were abundantly clear in 2024.  Storms were often severe, flooding was widespread, and parts of the continent were gripped by record-breaking heatwaves.  Experts from C3S and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warn that “additional fraction of a degree of temperature rise matters” as it accentuates the risk to people’s lives, to economies and to the planet.  The 2024 report “highlights that Europe is the fastest-warming continent and is experiencing serious impacts from extreme weather and climate change,” according to WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo.   All European regions saw a loss of ice last year as glaciers in Scandinavia and Svalbard experienced their highest rates of mass loss on record.  Wildfires in Portugal in September burned 110,000 hectares of land in a week - a quarter of Europe’s total annual burnt area for 2024. In total, blazes across the continent impact 42,000 people.  Flooding also had a dramatic and often deadly impact on communities across Europe. In September, Storm Boris affected hundreds of thousands of people with flooding, fatalities and damage in parts of Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia, Romania and Italy.  Then, at the end of October in Spain, extreme precipitation brought flooding with devastating impacts and fatalities for people in Valencia and neighbouring regions.  At least 232 people lost their lives in Valencia, with further fatalities in the provinces of Albacete, Cuenca and Malaga. Infrastructure damage and economic losses were severe, totalling around €16.5 billion. Storms and flooding across Europe last year affected a total of 413,000 people, led to the loss of at least 335 lives and are estimated to have cost at least €18 billion in damages.   Extreme heat, too, was a problem for many in 2024. In July, southeastern Europe experienced its longest heatwave on record, lasting 13 consecutive days and affecting 55 per cent of the region. In total, there were record-breaking numbers of days with at least ‘strong heat stress’ (66) and tropical nights (23) in southeastern Europe during the summer.  “Think 1.3°C of warming is safe? This report lays bare the pain Europe’s population is already suffering from extreme weather,” says Dr Friederike Otto, senior lecturer at the Centre for Environmental Policy and co-lead of World Weather Attribution at Imperial College London. Europe is one of the regions with the largest projected increase in flood risk, and 1.5C of warming could result in 30,000 annual deaths in Europe each year due to extreme heat, according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) data.  “But we’re on track to experience 3°C by 2100,” adds Otto, who wasn’t involved in the report. “You only need to cast your mind back to the floods in Spain, the fires in Portugal, or the summer heatwaves last year to know how devastating this level of warming would be.” Florence Rabier, director general of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, says these widespread climate impacts highlight the “importance of building greater resilience”.  Damage to the built environment from extreme weather events is expected to increase tenfold by the end of the century due to climate change alone. Flooding has been identified as the climate risk which most urgently needs action.  Some progress is already being made. The report highlights examples of adaptation initiatives in cities across Europe, from ‘tile whipping' in the Netherlands to boosting green spaces in Paris.  Rabier adds that 51 per cent of cities now have a dedicated climate adaptation plan - up from just 26 per cent in 2018 - underscoring the value of the information the report provides.  Saulo also says that the WMO is “intensifying efforts” to strengthen early warning systems for extreme weather events and climate services to help decision-makers and society at large to be more resilient. Continued efforts, however, are still needed to address both the current climate challenges Europe is facing and to prepare for future risks.  “We are making progress but need to go further and need to go faster, and we need to go together,” according to Saulo.  Adaptation is just one side of the coin, however, and climate experts say the growing risk from extreme weather emphasises the need to address a significant cause of this warming.  The “major suffering and losses” seen in Europe last year make it “all the more urgent to leave fossil fuels behind as fast as possible”, says Professor Stefan Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who wasn’t involved in the report. “The growing renewable share of now 45 per cent of our electricity is encouraging, and it is critical for our future to resist short-sighted fossil lobby interests and to implement the European climate goals without any delay.” The number of countries in Europe where renewables now generate more electricity than fossil fuels has nearly doubled since 2019, rising from 12 to 20. But, as the report points out, renewable power generation and electricity demand are also highly sensitive to weather conditions.  The continued use of fossil fuels in such a volatile global economy is “frankly insane”, adds Dr Otto.  “The EU can’t afford to put its climate commitments on the backburner. It needs to lead the charge and accelerate the shift to evidence-based politics, actually helping low-income people and not oligarchs.”"

Footage from the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel showed firefighters working to extinguish a fire, allegedly caused by the airstrikes. The aftermath showed rubble scattered across a street, with one person being carried away from the site, which the Houthis identified as a ceramics factory in the Bani Matar neighbourhood of Sanaa, the capital. The Houthis reported further strikes in Hodeida, al-Jawaf, and Marib governorates, though no casualties were mentioned. The US military’s Central Command, responsible for overseeing operations, has not confirmed the airstrikes. The White House has stated that over 200 airstrikes have been carried out as part of the ongoing campaign, which started on 15 March. US airstrikes have targeted the rebels for their attacks on shipping in Middle Eastern waters, related to the Israel-Hamas conflict. These strikes have resulted in over 120 deaths, according to the Houthis' Health Ministry. Meanwhile, the Houthis have claimed that they shot down an American MQ-9 Reaper drone on Sunday night over Yemen's Hajjah governorate, located near Saudi Arabia’s border on the Red Sea. Houthi military spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree said this was the fourth such downing in two weeks, using a ""locally manufactured missile."" The rebels possess surface-to-air missiles, such as the Iranian-made 358 missile, capable of downing aircraft. While Iran denies arming the rebels, Tehran-manufactured weapons have been found in Yemen, despite a US arms embargo. The US campaign in Yemen shows no sign of stopping, with the Trump administration also tying these strikes to a broader effort to pressure Iran over its nuclear ambitions. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the operations demonstrate the US's ability to strike deep and far, asserting that it aims to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons."

Speaking in the Oval Office during his meeting with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele on Monday, Trump seized on the latest monthly consumer price report, which shows a 2.4% inflation rate for March. ""We have to solve problems, and we already solved inflation. You know, if you look at the numbers, the numbers are incredible, actually. The stock market's up,"" Trump told reporters. ""And we're not letting other countries take advantage of this country like they have for the last 40 years,” he added. Trump also pointed to tech giant Nvidia's announcement that it will produce artificial intelligence supercomputers in the US for the first time as evidence of the success of his tariffs. ""Well, it's one of the biggest announcements you'll ever hear, because Nvidia, as you know, controls almost the entire sector, which is one of most important sectors in the world, between chips and semiconductors and everything else. And they're the biggest,"" Trump said. ""And the reason they did it is because of the election on 5 November and because of a thing called tariffs, as I said, the most beautiful word in the dictionary,"" he explained. Trump spoke following a turbulent week in the markets, during which his administration rolled back some of its most aggressive tariffs. Global stock markets saw gains on Monday after Trump temporarily eased certain tariffs, and tensions within the US bond market also appeared to lessen. Wall Street was buoyed by strong performances from Apple and other tech companies, following Trump’s announcement that smartphones, computers, and several other electronic products would be exempt from the latest round of tariffs. The move helped prevent potential price hikes for American consumers on goods imported from China. This exemption is expected to benefit US importers, who would otherwise face the difficult choice of either passing on the increased costs to customers or absorbing the financial hit themselves. The US president has also said he plans to provide temporary exemptions to carmakers on his tariffs. “I’m looking at something to help some of the car companies with it,” Trump told reporters. He explained that the automotive industry needed more time to shift its production from countries like Canada and Mexico back to the US. ""And they need a little bit of time because they’re going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time. So I’m talking about things like that,” he said. Global stock markets also rebounded as tensions in Trump’s trade war with China, the world’s second-largest economy, began to ease. Market indexes rose by 2.4% in France, 2.9% in Germany, 1.2% in Japan and 1% in South Korea."

Two ballistic missiles hit the city at around 10:15am, according to Ukrainian officials, striking an area housing a number of religious buildings where many residents were gathering to celebrate Palm Sunday. ""This is the centre of the city, the central part, and yesterday was a big religious holiday. There are religious buildings on both sides of the street where the shelling took place. People were going to worship, so there were a lot of injured and wounded people,"" explained Oleh Strilka, a spokesperson for Emergency Service in Sumy region. Strilka described how fire crews battled to put out the remains of burned-out cars scattered among the rubble of damaged buildings and said emergency teams were still clearing shards of glass the day after the attack. Many people have gathered to lay flowers at makeshift memorials in honour of the deceased. European leaders have condemned the attack as a war crime, with Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, calling the strikes “Russia’s mocking answer” to Kyiv’s agreement to a ceasefire proposed by the United States over a month ago. Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen also pointed out that the attack on Sumy occurred just after President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, visited Saint Petersburg for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. She stated that this highlights how “Russia shows full disregard for the peace process, but also that Russia has zero regard for human life."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has welcomed the international response to Russia's attack but says more pressure on Moscow is needed to bring an end to the war. “Only real pressure on Russia can stop this. We need tangible sanctions against those sectors that finance the Russian killing machine,” he wrote on X. Speaking in his nightly address on Monday, the Ukrainian President said ""Russian state propagandists are preparing their audience for the fact that negotiations and diplomacy will not work"".  ""They are not afraid in Moscow right now. And if there is not enough pressure on Russia, they will continue to do what they are used to - continue to fight,"" he added. Meanwhile Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov claims the missiles were targeting ""Ukrainian military commanders and their Western colleagues"" in Sumy, accusing Kyiv of using civilians as shields by holding military meetings in the city's centre. The Russian defence ministry also stated the attack killed more than 60 troops, but did not offer any evidence to back its claims."

The offer comes as Israel expanded its military offensive across Gaza over the weekend. More than a third of the money, to be provided over two years, will come as direct budget support to the PA and is aimed at improving financial sustainability, democratic governance and services to help the private sector develop. ""Our programme aims to support the Palestinian people in building a sustainable future,"" said EU Mediterranean Commissioner Dubravka Šuica. ""It's about the governing capacity. It's about advancing economic recovery. It's about strengthening the resilience of the private sector."" Speaking to reporters after talks in Luxembourg with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, she said ""a well-functioning and reformed Palestinian Authority must play a central role in the post-conflict governance of Gaza. This is our position."" Over €576 million in grants will go to fund projects in several sectors across the Palestinian territories, with €82 million going to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. The private sector can benefit from up to €400 million euros in low-cost loans from the EU, the world's largest aid donor to the Palestinians. Meanwhile, on Sunday Israel struck a hospital in northern Gaza, forcing patients to evacuate as attacks intensified across the Strip.  Gaza's Health Ministry said the pre-dawn strike hit the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City after Israel issued an evacuation warning. At least one patient died during the evacuation as staff couldn't provide urgent care.  Israel said it struck a Hamas command centre in the hospital. It also claimed that prior to the strike, steps were taken to mitigate harm. Hamas described the Israeli targeting of the hospital as a ""new war crime"" and said it was part of a series of attacks targeting the health infrastructure in Gaza. The war in Gaza started after Hamas fighters carried out an attack on southern Israel on 7 October, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians.  251 hostages were taken, most of whom have since been released as part of negotiations between the two parties. 59 hostages remain, 24 of which are believed to still be alive.  The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza but doesn't differentiate between combatants and civilians in its tally."

The amendment, which required a two-thirds vote, passed along party lines with 140 votes for and 21 against. It was proposed by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. The amendment declares that children's rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any right other than the right to life, including the right to peacefully assemble. The amendment codifies a law fast-tracked through parliament in March that bans public events held by LGBTQ+ communities, including the popular Pride event in Budapest that draws thousands of visitors annually. That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify people who attend prohibited events and can come with fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints (€481). Ahead of the vote, the final step for the amendment, opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to blockade the entrance to one of parliament’s parking garages. Police physically removed demonstrators, who had used zip ties to bind themselves together. Dávid Bedő, a lawmaker with the opposition Momentum party who participated in the attempted blockade, said before the vote that Orbán and Fidesz for the past 15 years ""have been dismantling democracy and the rule of law and in the past two or three months, we see that this process has been sped up."" He said as elections approach in 2026 and Orbán's party lags in the polls behind a popular new challenger from the opposition, ""they will do everything in their power to stay in power."" Opposition lawmakers used air horns to disrupt the vote, which continued after a few moments. Hungary's government has campaigned against LGBTQ+ communities in recent years, and argues its child protection policies, which forbid the availability to minors of any material that mentions homosexuality, are needed to protect children from what it calls ""woke ideology"" and ""gender madness."" Critics say the measures do little to protect children and are being used to distract from more serious problems facing the country and mobilize Orbán's right-wing base ahead of elections. ""This whole endeavour which we see launched by the government, it has nothing to do with children's rights,"" said Dánel Döbrentey, a lawyer with the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, dismissing it as ""pure propaganda."" The new amendment also states that the constitution recognizes two sexes, male and female, an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man. The declaration provides a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals who are born with sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female. In a statement on Monday, government spokesperson Zoltán Kovács wrote that the change is ""not an attack on individual self-expression, but a clarification that legal norms are based on biological reality."" Lawyer Dánel Döbrentey said it was ""a clear message"" for transgender and intersex people: ""It is definitely and purely and strictly about humiliating people and excluding them, not just from the national community, but even from the community of human beings."" The amendment also allows for Hungarians who hold dual citizenship in a non-European Economic Area country to have their citizenship suspended for up to 10 years if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security. Hungary has taken steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orbán's government. The self-described ""illiberal"" leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary's sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors. In a speech last month, Orbán compared people who work for such groups to insects and pledged to ""eliminate the entire shadow army"" of foreign-funded ""politicians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists."""
fae7d77e-ad85-440d-a4ee-8f872ff4c5df,https://www.euronews.com/culture/2025/04/14/pope-francis-approves-first-step-towards-the-beatification-of-catalan-architect-antoni-gau,04.14.2025 18:05 GMT+1,Pope Francis approves first step towards the beatification of Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí,"The legendary Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, known affectionately as ""God's architect"" for his pioneering work creating Barcelona's Sagrada Familia basilica, has moved one step closer up the path to being made a saint. It's now emerged that while he was still convalescing from his respiratory infection, Pope Francis received Italian Catholic Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints, and signed a number of decrees, including one on the Catalan architect. Despite being a layman, the Holy See allowed Gaudí to be buried in the Sagrada Família, the church he designed. The process for the architect's beatification is now underway in Rome, and a tribunal has to determine whether there have been any miraculous events connected with him. The Sagrada Família is expected to be completed in 2026, coinciding with the centenary of Gaudí's death. Once its spires are completed, the Sagrada Família will become the tallest cathedral in the world. In the Catholic Church, the steps to sainthood are: to become a servant of God, then venerable, blessed, and finally a saint. Gaudí, born on 25 June 1852 and died on 10 June 1926 in Barcelona, is already deemed to be a servant on his journey towards beatification and will have to go through several stages. Once he is declared ""venerable servant of God"", a title given to a deceased person who is recognised as having ""lived the virtues in a heroic manner"", he would have to be declared blessed and only then a saint. The case of a woman from Reus who claims to have recovered her sight thanks to her devotion to Gaudí, together with a biography with testimonies of people who knew him are some evidence of this supposed sanctity, according to an investigation by the state broadcaster TVE. For a venerable person to be beatified, it is necessary for a miracle to have taken place due to his intercession, and for him to be canonised or made a saint, a second miracle worked through his intercession is required, after he has been proclaimed blessed. The process of beatification of the architect was promoted 30 years ago by the Association for the Beatification of Antoni Gaudí, founded in 1992 and chaired by José Manuel Almuzara. According to the canonical association, Gaudí was ""a witness of faith, a man of faith, a great observer of nature and a brilliant architect, and has become a universal figure of modern architecture. His contribution to this discipline broke with established patterns. The testimony of faith he offered during his lifetime is reflected in his most important work, the Sagrada Família in Barcelona. In March 2000, the Holy See authorised the formal opening of the diocesan process of beatification, which led to the constitution of the corresponding tribunal to investigate his reputation for sanctity. On his trip to Spain in 2010, Pope Benedict XVI, when he consecrated the Sagrada Família, defined Gaudí as a ""brilliant architect and consistent Christian who overcame the current split between human conscience and Christian conscience, between existence in this temporal world and openness to an eternal life, between the beauty of things and God as Beauty""."

The celebrated Peruvian writer, and Nobel Laureate in Literature, has died at the age of 89 in Lima, leaving a huge void in the world of letters. His death has shocked readers, writers and world leaders, who have expressed their grief at the loss of one of the most influential voices of the 20th century. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez described him as ""a master of words"". In a message on the social network X, he expressed his gratitude ""as a reader for an immense work, for so many key books to understand our times"". ""On behalf of the Government of Spain, I send my condolences to the family, friends and the great community of readers around the world"", Pedro Sánchez continued. The Royal Household has sent condolences to his family via social media. Vargas Llosa received the Prince of Asturias Award for Literature from the hands of the now King Felipe VI in 1986. Author of works such as ""The City and the Dogs"" and ""The Feast of the Goat"", he not only left his mark on Latin American literature, but also became a global icon. In a statement from Peru, his native country, the government mourned ""the death of Mario Vargas Llosa, universal writer and distinguished winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. His intellectual genius and his vast oeuvre will remain an enduring legacy for future generations"". On the streets of Madrid, the city that welcomed the writer in his last years, the sadness of his fans was widely reflected. ""I loved Vargas Llosa, he had a great impact on me. ""The Feast of the goat"" (La fiesta del chivo) left its mark on me, but also ""Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter"" (La tía Julia y el escribidor), a marvellous novel,"" one reader told Euronews. Another admirer of the writer highlighted his human qualities: ""Beyond his books, I liked him as a person"". Speaking to Euronews, the former director of the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language (RAE), Darío Villanueva, of which Vargas Llosa was an academician, said that he was ""a universal writer, very cosmopolitan, faithful to his Peruvian roots but also to Spain"". His ability to weave complex stories with an accessible style made him a favourite with the public. Villanueva, who had been very close to the author for years, underlined his relevance: ""His prose was aesthetically demanding, but always accessible. He managed to merge cultured and popular literature, leading readers to enjoy his extraordinary narrative"". Vargas Llosa's impact transcends borders. His work, influenced by his life in Paris, London and Madrid, integrated the European literary tradition with his Latin American roots. Novels such as 'Conversation in the Cathedral' and 'The Green House' reflect this fusion, which revitalised Spanish-language fiction. ""His success with 'The City and the Dogs' in 1963 was a revulsive for the Spanish novel, which was at a dead end,"" explained Villanueva. This impulse extended to the Latin American 'boom', where Vargas Llosa, along with names such as Gabriel García Márquez, reoriented Hispanic literature towards an overflowing imagination and a seductive style. His commitment to form and history made him an inescapable point of reference. Beyond his novels, Vargas Llosa was a literary critic, journalist and essayist of enormous relevance. His columns in 'El País', published in its 'Touchstone' (Piedra de toque) section, offered sharp reflections on reality. ""Mario was a great critic and literary theorist, but also a friend of enormous sympathy, sincere and courteous,"" recalled Villanueva, visibly affected. His time at the RAE, where he was an active participant, left an indelible mark. ""He gave splendour to the Academy with his ability to assume the variants of Spanish and his authority as a writer,"" says Villanueva. His acceptance speech, dedicated to the Spanish novelist Azorín, and his admiration for authors such as Flaubert and Faulkner, show his connection to world literature. Mario Vargas Llosa's legacy will live on in every page he wrote and in the memory of those who will continue to read him. As Villanueva says,""his void is impossible to fill"". Today, the world bids farewell to the eternal 'scribe', but his stories will live on."

The coastguard said the migrants and bodies were found Monday morning but the vessel they had used to make the journey from Turkey was not located. Officials said there were no reports of any missing people, nor any immediate information on the migrants' nationalities or how their boat had sunk. Earlier this month, at least 16 people died when two dinghies sank, one in Turkish and one in Greek waters, as dozens of migrants attempted to make their way from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands. Greece is a main entry point into the European Union for people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Many make the short but often treacherous journey from the Turkish coast to Greek islands in inflatable dinghies or other small boats. Many are not seaworthy or set out in bad weather and fatal accidents are common. The Greek government has cracked down with increased patrols at sea. Many smuggling rings have shifted their operations south, using larger boats to transport people from the northern coast of Africa to southern Greece. Last year, more than 54,000 people used what has become known as the eastern Mediterranean route heading to Greece and more than 7,700 crossed Greece’s small land border with Turkey, according to figures from the UN refugee agency. There were 125 people reported dead or missing. The UN high commissioner for refugees has said over 8,000 people arrived in Greece by sea and 755 by land between the start of this year and 30 March."

Italy's Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told journalists in Japan that the Italian government had agreed to host the talks, while his Iranian counterpart on Monday said the next round of talks will ""probably be held somewhere other than Oman."" ""It's not an important matter,"" Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Esmail Baghaei, told journalists at a press conference in Tehran. Neither Iranian nor US officials immediately acknowledged the venue of the second round of negotiations but Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said the coming talks would be in Rome. Speaking at a meeting in Luxembourg, Veldkamp claimed the talks could take place on Saturday 19 April. However, with the change of venue, it's likely that Oman, which hosted the first round of talks on Saturday in Muscat, would continue to mediate between the two sides. Earlier on Sunday, US President Donald Trump hailed the first round of talks, describing them as ""positive"" and ""constructive. "" Trump said he expected to decide on Iran ""very quickly."" As the two countries approach the end of a half-century of hostility, the stakes in negotiations could not be higher. If a deal isn't reached, Trump has warned that the US could launch air strikes targeting Iran's nuclear programme, while officials in Tehran have said that their uranium stockpile, which has been enriched to levels close to weapons-grade, may be used to develop a nuclear bomb. Meanwhile, analysts say that while the US can offer sanctions relief for Iran's beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Judging from negotiations since 2018, Iran is expected to ask to continue enriching uranium up to at least 20%. ""There must definitely be guarantees in place regarding the fulfilment of commitments,"" Baghaei said on Monday. ""The issue of guarantees is especially important given the history of broken promises in the past. God willing, the negotiating team will continue its work with all these factors and points in mind,"" he added. Later this week, Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will travel to Iran for talks. After Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement, the IAEA continued to function in the Islamic Republic even as the country's government gradually reduced its access to nuclear sites. The IAEA was instrumental in confirming Iran's adherence to the agreement with the pact's other signatories. ""Continued engagement and cooperation with the agency are essential at a time when diplomatic solutions are urgently needed,"" Grossi wrote in a post on X."

Among the shared and commented videos in these ""do it yourself"" trends are recipes or regimens on how to lose weight quickly without leaving the house; whether by making drinks with ingredients you have on hand in the kitchen, or slathering your skin with oil. The castor oil application and coffee with lemon drink are two of the most popular trends shared so far on TikTok in 2025. One post about castor oil alone has garnered 49,000 likes, meanwhile, the coffee with lemon trend, which started gaining popularity on the platform in 2024, remains one of TikTok's most popular weight loss trends this year, with individual posts reaching up to 25,900 likes. But how do these popular tricks work, if at all? Euronews Health spoke with experts to break down these two viral weight loss trends. One of the more recent viral TikTok weight loss trends involves the application of castor oil on the stomach. Various TikTokers claim that rubbing the oil made from pressed castor beans on your belly daily can flatten the stomach in just a few weeks. Priya Tew, Specialist Dietitian and director of Dietitian UK and media spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association explained that while applying castor oil to your stomach will not cause harm, it will not lead to significant weight loss either. ""There is no proof that this can reach your insides. So therefore what we're actually doing is moisturising our tummy. So if you would like a lovely moisturised tummy, then go ahead,"" she said. According to Tew, it’s important to understand that not everything that you see on screen is the absolute truth. ""It's very easy to watch one of these videos and go, 'oh wow, look at that change that happened,’ and get sucked into it,"" she said. ""But quite a lot of the time, these things are being faked"". Dr Adam Collins, professor of Nutrition at Surrey University, offers a similar point of view. ""Certainly [there is] no metabolic reason why that would affect the functioning of your subcutaneous and certainly is not going to affect your visceral fat,"" Collins told Euronews Health. Another viral TikTok weight loss trend involves adding lemon to coffee, with claims that the combination boosts metabolism and helps burn fat more effectively due to the caffeine. However, adding lemon to coffee does not enhance a quick weight loss effect, according to Collins. ""It's not like all of a sudden you're going to be burning hundreds of calories more, or burning tens and hundreds of grams of fat,"" he said. ""[...] unless you increase the dose of the caffeine quite high. But then that has other damaging effects"". ""They're almost like using it inadvertently as like a meal replacement or a meal displacement... And that's what people who advocate don't care. They just want to sell it,"" he added. While coffee can slightly increase metabolism and improve alertness, its impact can create a counterbalancing effect in food satiety according to Dr Christophe Matthys, professor of Human Nutrition at KU Leuven, head of Clinical Nutrition Unit, University Hospitals Leuven. ""If people start consuming a lot of caffeine, for example, they will have potential sleep deprivation,"" said Matthys. ""There will be a hormonal reaction and a response that is kind of delaying your satiety level again, which is kind of stimulating you to eat more"". Social media trends can not only mislead someone to an improper weight loss diet but also influence users' relationship with food. ""People start having very strange relationships that are not necessarily related based on any physiology or immunology,"" said Matthys. ""But more from a mental psychological point of view. Then it becomes very difficult to re-install a normal relationship with food, especially in young people"". Although tips and trends may seem to be easy fixes, the reality is that sustainable results require long-term commitment, Tew highlighted. ""Think about what are the small changes you can make that you can sustain. It could be adding an extra portion of fruit to your day, for example, or choosing to snack on some nuts instead of some crisps,"" she said. ""But it's these tiny little changes that actually, if you keep going with them, are going to make the difference"". Tew also reminded that body size is not always an indicator of health. ""We can be healthy in all sizes, shapes, and bodies. So if you are in a large size body, it doesn't mean that you are unhealthy,"" she said. ""It doesn't necessarily mean that you do need to lose weight [...] you could be perfectly fine where you are,"" Tew added."

An estimated €5 billion will be required to meet the target by the end of the year. ""We still don't have 100% but we definitely need to move forward with that,"" Kallas told reporters after a meeting of foreign affairs ministers in Luxembourg. ""A large majority of member states agreed that we need to do more."" The ammunition initiative is considered the most feasible element of the €40 billion plan that Kallas put forward in March but that EU leaders failed to embrace in its entirety. The pledges made so far by countries combine actual donations of ammunition and fresh funding for procuring the ammunition, Kallas explained. ""It is, of course, commitments but commitments need to be followed,"" she said. The shells should arrive in Ukraine ""as soon as possible,"" she noted, calling on governments to also provide air defence systems that can help the country repel Russia's increasingly brutal attacks against civilian population and infrastructure. The meeting on Monday happened a day after two Russian ballistic missiles struck the city of Sumy as the Christian faithful celebrated Palm Sunday. At least 34 people were killed and more than 110 were injured. The devastation has renewed calls for fresh sanctions against the Kremlin. Since February 2022, the bloc has approved 16 packages of restrictions, the last of which was endorsed in the lead-up to the war's third anniversary. According to the High Representative, internal work on the 17th package is already underway with the goal of presenting ministers with a fleshed-out proposal in May. ""If you want the killing to stop, you should put the pressure on Russia, which actually does the killing,"" Kallas said. Asked if the next package should target Russian exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which remain unspared, Kallas replied doing so would help cripple the Kremlin's war machine but admitted unanimity might be impossible to secure. Poland, the Nordics and the Baltics are among those who have repeatedly demanded a halt in purchases of Russian LNG, which last year totalled €7 billion across the bloc. ""Putting the sanctions on oil and gas and putting more on that side would have a bigger effect because this is how they're funding the war,"" Kallas said. ""The discussions are ongoing but you know very well we need 27 countries to agree. But my point is that we should put as a strong package together as possible, hopefully also with our international partners."" Diplomats in Brussels expect the next round of sanctions to be immediately resisted by Hungary. Budapest has become increasingly critical of economic restrictions, going as far as threatening to block their renewal."

Craig Williams, who was the MP for Montgomeryshire and parliamentary private secretary to ex-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the time he placed the bet, was one of several individuals investigated for cashing in on insider knowledge on the date that Sunak would call the election. It's legal for politicians and party officials in the UK to wager on elections, but the investigation examined whether they used inside information to gain an unfair advantage. Sunak took most by surprise when he announced in May last year that he was setting the election date for 4 July — most had expected that it would not take place until after the summer. The other individuals facing charges included Russell George, a Conservative member of the Welsh parliament; Thomas James, the director of the Welsh Conservatives; Simon Chatfield, a former chief marketing officer for the party; and Anthony Lee, a former Conservative campaign director, the Gambling Commission said on Monday. A former police officer was also among those charged with cheating, which carries a potential two-year prison sentence in the case of a conviction. The probe, launched in June 2024, specifically probed ""individuals suspected of using confidential information — specifically advance knowledge of the proposed election date — to gain an unfair advantage in betting markets"", the Gambling Commission said. Williams has previously admitted to placing a £100 (€116) bet on a July election three days before Sunak announced the date of the poll. ""I committed an error of judgment, not an offence, and I want to reiterate my apology directly to you,"" he said in a video posted on social media in June.  The bet could have resulted in a £500 (€580) payout with odds of 5/1. Williams lost his seat in the election, coming third. Those charged are due to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 13 June, the Gambling Commission said. The scandal — which emerged following a report in the Guardian newspaper about alleged bets placed on a July election days before Sunak’s announcement — was embarrassing for the party, which was subsequently driven out of power for the first time in 14 years by Labour. The newspaper reported at the time that it understood that Ladbrokes had automatically raised a red flag following Williams' bet as he was a ""politically exposed person"". ""The Conservative Party believes that those working in politics must act with integrity,"" the party spokesperson said. ""Current members of staff who have been charged are being suspended with immediate effect."""

The office said in a statement that the Syrian man, himself a migrant, was convicted on three charges including people trafficking and aiding migrants to enter Cyprus. The court ruled that he struck a deal with traffickers to captain the boat from an unnamed Syrian port in exchange for not having to pay the fee for the journey. The statement didn't say when the boat reached Cyprus. According to the ruling, the man received training on how to operate the boat and was in radio contact with another trafficker who instructed him on the route. ""With his actions, the accused, without any hesitation, made himself an active part of a group taking advantage of people,"" the court said. Such acts need to be dealt with severely because of their increasing frequency, the court said. Syria is about 93 nautical miles (173 kilometres) from European Union member Cyprus' south-eastern corner. Stepped-up prosecutions and swift legal proceedings have contributed to a drop in the number of migrants reaching Cyprus after a government pledge to tackle the issue. It became a key issue during the 2023 presidential election. According to statistics from the attorney general's office, the international protection administrative court adjudicated 4,534 cases last year, of which 63 were successful. Twenty-five of those migrants were granted refugee status, and four received international protection. The court upheld the status for another 25 and ordered a retrial for the remaining eight. But the United Nations refugee agency has accused Cyprus of continuing to engage in pushbacks at sea, something the Cypriot government denies."

The attacks sparked multiple fires and caused significant damage to residential buildings, commercial properties and medical facilities. Ukraine’s Air Force reported on its Telegram channel that Russia launched a total of 62 drones overnight, targeting the regions of Odesa, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv. Of those, 40 drones were intercepted and shot down, while 11 lost contact with radar systems. The latest wave of strikes comes just hours after a deadly attack on the northeastern town of Sumy, where at least 34 people were killed and 117 injured, according to Ukrainian authorities. The attack occurred on Sunday morning as residents gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday. Two ballistic missiles struck the town centre, which is around 40 kilometres from the Russian border. Ukrainian officials said the missile attacks included the use of cluster munitions, a type of weapon that releases or ejects smaller submunitions. In a social media post on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks. ""Only real pressure on Russia can stop this. Tangible sanctions are needed against the sectors that finance Russia’s killing machine,"" he wrote. ""The one who brought the war must be stopped and held accountable for what they have done; that is only fair,"" he added. Governments around the world have condemned the Russian attack in Sumy. “I hope that President Trump, the US administration, see that the leader of Russia is mocking their goodwill, and I hope the right decisions are taken,” said Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, referring to Washington's attempts to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Elina Valtonen, Finland's foreign minister, noted that the attack on Sumy came shortly after President Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Saint Petersburg for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. It demonstrates that “Russia shows full disregard for the peace process, but also that Russia has zero regard for human life,"" Valtonen said."

Imamoglu, a prominent opposition figure and a key challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s more than two-decade rule, was detained on 19 March and formally jailed on corruption and terrorism charges four days later. That triggered the biggest protests in Turkey in more than a decade, with nearly 2,000 people detained for taking part. The arrest of Imamoglu is widely considered as politically motivated ahead of presidential elections, which currently are set for 2028 but could take place earlier. The Turkish government has maintained that the judiciary operates independently and without political interference. On Monday, the Istanbul Criminal Court of First Instance ruled to reject the appeals made by Imamoglu’s lawyers, deciding that his detention would continue, Anadolu reported. Lawyers representing the mayor had argued that the investigation into Imamoglu was conducted in violation of legal norms. They are expected to renew the appeals request. The court also rejected appeals requests for Murat Ongun — the chairman of a media company affiliated with the Istanbul municipality and close Imamoglu aide — and other suspects who were arrested on corruption charges alongside the mayor. Imamoglu was officially nominated as the presidential candidate for the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) while in custody. Nearly 15 million people — of whom 13 million were non-party members voting in solidarity — backed Imamoglu as the party's candidate in an internal vote held on 23 March, which was planned before his detention. Before his recent detention, Imamoglu had already faced multiple criminal cases that could result in prison sentences and a political ban. He was also appealing a 2022 conviction for insulting members of Turkey’s Supreme Electoral Council. Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey’s largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and the president’s Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan’s party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities. The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against Erdogan’s governing party."

Joining John Lithgow as the previously announced Albus Dumbledore is Janet McTeer (Tumbleweeds, The Menu, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning) as Professor Minerva McGonagall, Paapa Essiedu (I May Destroy You, Gangs of London) as Professor Severus Snape, and Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) as groundskeeper Hagrid.  Two guest stars were announced: Luke Thallon, who will play Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Quirinus Quirrell and Paul Whitehouse as Mr. Filch, the Hogwarts caretaker.  “We are happy to announce the casting of John Lithgow, Janet McTeer, Paapa Essiedu, Nick Frost, Luke Thallon and Paul Whitehouse to play Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Hagrid, Quirrell and Filch,” said Francesca Gardiner, showrunner and executive producer, and Mark Mylod, director of multiple episodes and executive producer. “We’re delighted to have such extraordinary talent onboard, and we can’t wait to see them bring these beloved characters to new life.” There have been no casting announcements for the central roles of Harry, Hermione and Ron. As for the all-important role of Voldemort, there have been rumours that Cillian Murphy is the favourite to nab the role. The new casting announcement will probably be controversial, as the early rumours that Essiedu was being considered to play Snape were not welcome by certain corners of the internet. Others looked down on the fact that an American actor had been cast to play Dumbledore. Watch this space. The show will restart the popular book-to-film franchise from the beginning. The plan is for each season of the show to adapt a single book from controversial author J.K. Rowling’s franchise, starting with ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone"".  Here is the series’ official synopsis:  The series will be a faithful adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter book series by author and executive producer J.K. Rowling and will feature an exciting and talented cast to lead a new generation of fandom, full of the fantastic detail and much-loved characters Harry Potter fans have adored for over 25 years. Exploring every corner of the wizarding world, each season will bring Harry Potter and its incredible adventures to new and existing audiences and will stream exclusively on Max where it’s available globally, including upcoming markets such as Turkey, the UK, Germany, and Italy, among others. The original, classic, and cherished films will remain at the core of the franchise and available to watch around the world.  HBO and Max have yet to announce a premiere date for the series, which is expected to begin filming this summer."

The S&P 500 was 1.5% higher in early trading. That comes after a chaotic week where it careened through historic swings as financial markets struggled to catch up with Trump’s moves on tariffs, which investors fear could lead to a recession. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 441 points, or 1.1%, at the opening, and the Nasdaq composite was 2% higher. Apple, Nvidia and other big technology companies led the way on Wall Street after Trump said he was exempting smartphones, computers and some other electronics from some of his stiff tariffs, which could ultimately more than double prices for US customers of many goods coming from China. Such an exemption should help US importers, which would not have to choose between passing on the higher costs to their customers or taking a hit to their own profits. Apple climbed 5.3%, Nvidia rose 2.3%, and Dell Technologies jumped 5.9%. Stock markets in other countries likewise bounced following the cooldown in Trump’s trade war with China, the world’s second-largest economy. Indexes climbed 2.2% in France, 2.7% in Germany, and 1.7% in the UK at the time of the US market's opening. But the relief may prove fleeting. Trump’s tariff rollout has been full of fits and starts, and officials in his administration said this most recent exemption on electronics is only temporary. Perhaps more encouragingly for Wall Street, the bond market was also showing signs of increasing calm. Treasury yields eased a bit following their sudden and scary rise last week, which seemed to rattle not only investors but also Trump himself. Treasury yields usually drop when fear is high in the market because US government bonds have historically been seen as some of the world’s safest investments, if not the safest. But last week, yields rose unusually sharply for Treasury bonds. The value of the US dollar also fell against other currencies in another move suggesting investors may no longer see the United States as the best place to keep their cash during moments of stress. Trump referred to the moves in the bond market when he announced a 90-day pause on many of his tariffs last week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased back to 4.40%. It had jumped to 4.48% on Friday from 4.01% the week before. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs rose 2.7% after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. It joined other big banks in doing so, such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. ""With the latest results season starting in earnest this week, every statement will be closely analysed to get a view on what tariffs will do to the bottom line, and crucially what other companies are doing with their IT spend,” Ben Barringer, global technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said. Coming later this week are the latest financial results from Bank of America, United Airlines and Netflix, among others. Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut its forecast for growth in crude demand for this year and 2026, citing the impact of US trade tariffs. US benchmark crude oil as well as Brent crude were up by around 1% at the US market opening, pushing the cost of WTI to just above $62 a barrel, while the Brent climbed to $65.57 per barrel. The US dollar dropped to 143.06 Japanese yen from 143.91 yen. The euro climbed to $1.1404 from $1.1320. The safe-haven investment gold retreated from record levels, signalling a returning risk appetite on the markets, trading 0.7% lower in the US opening, falling to around $3,220 per ounce. But the price is expected to climb further. US investment bank Goldman Sachs has lifted its 2025 target to $3,700 an ounce from $3,300. Other strategists see gold reaching $4,000 by June 2026, as reported by Marketwatch. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said Trump's weekend tariff announcement was ""a small step"" toward fixing the president's so-called ""reciprocal"" duties. China urged him to cancel them completely. China had announced Friday that it was boosting its tariffs on US products to 125% in the latest tit-for-tat increase following Trump's escalations on imports from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.4% to 21,417.40, while the Shanghai Composite index picked up 0.8% to 3,262.81 after the government reported that China's exports surged 12.4% in March from a year earlier in a last-minute flurry of activity as companies rushed to beat increases in US tariffs imposed by Trump.

It was the latest wave in space tourism, where more of the rich and famous than ever before - or lucky and well-connected - can enter the zero-gravity realm traditionally dominated by professional astronauts. The New Shepard rocket blasted off on the quick up-and-down trip from West Texas. The fringes of space beckoned some 105 km up, promising a few precious minutes of weightlessness. Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, invited the others along for the 10-minute, fully automated flight, packing on the star power with singer-songwriter Perry and 'CBS Mornings' co-host King. Also sharing the ride were film producer Kerianne Flynn; Aisha Bowe, a former NASA engineer who started her own companies to promote science education; and Amanda Nguyen, a scientist who studied planets around other stars and now advocates for survivors of sexual violence. Blue Origin declined to say how much the flight cost or who paid what. The trip came two months before Sanchez and Bezos marry in Venice. It was the 11th human spaceflight for the Washington state-based company, founded by Bezos in 2000 after making a fortune with Amazon. Bezos strapped in for Blue Origin’s first space tourist flight in 2021 and accompanied the latest crew to the pad. The celebrity launch was the nation’s first spaceflight where women filled each seat. The only other all-female crew in 64 years of human spaceflight was back in 1963. That’s when Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova launched by herself, becoming the first woman in space. Tereshkova spent three days off the planet. Even after the latest launch, women represent barely 15 per cent of the more than 700 people who have traveled into space. Sanchez said she deliberately chose women to launch with her, each of them eager to inspire both the young and old to dream big, and even commissioned special flight suits. ""It’s an important moment for the future of commercial space travel and for humanity in general and for women all around,"" Perry told The Associated Press last week. The launch brought out VIPs to West Texas including Oprah Winfrey, Kris Jenner, and other members of the Kardashian family, and several women who previously have flown on private flights. Winfrey, a close friend of King, wiped away tears when the capsule reached space and the passengers were heard marveling at the moon and shouting with joy. As the women were buckling up after a few minutes of weightlessness, Perry sang a few lines of ""What a Wonderful World,"" King said in a post-launch televised interview. Bezos opened the capsule's hatch minutes after touchdown, embracing Sanchez, the first one out. As they emerged, Perry and King kneeled and kissed the ground. “Oh my God, that was amazing,” said King, who considers herself an anxious airplane flyer. This wasn't the first Blue Origin launch with marquee names. 'Star Trek' actor William Shatner caught a lift to space with Blue Origin in 2021 at age 90, soon after Bezos’ inaugural trip. He was followed by former New York Giants defensive end and TV host Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley, the eldest daughter of Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard, for whom the rocket is named. Two aviation pioneers who missed out on space when they were younger - Wally Funk and Ed Dwight - also rocketed away at ages 82 and 90, respectively. Most of Blue Origin's passengers - 58 counting the latest launch - have been business or science types, TV hosts, or YouTubers. Ticket prices are not disclosed. The Russian Space Agency also has launched its share of space tourists, beginning with a California financier in 2001. Two decades later, a Russian actress filmed aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Elon Musk’s SpaceX also sells multi-day trips to private customers. SpaceX's first client to fly, billionaire tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman already has launched twice and performed the first private spacewalk. He's now set to become NASA's next administrator if confirmed by the US Senate. Chinese-born Bitcoin investor Chun Wang just returned from the first spaceflight to carry people over the north and south poles. Wang picked up the whole SpaceX tab for himself and three polar explorers for an undisclosed sum. ""In this exciting new era of commercial spaceflight, the dream of becoming an astronaut is no longer limited to a select few,"" Wang said via X last week."

The Iberian Peninsula faces the most critical conditions with several red warnings, the result of alternating periods of drought and intense winter and spring precipitation. In 2023, Spain already had the largest territory affected by drought, at 34,000 square km, followed by Poland with 24,000 and Lithuania with 20,000. At the same time, orange warnings are present in swathes of Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Poland, Belarus, most of Ukraine, as well as Ireland, Scotland and a few spots in Germany and France. The increasing use of water resources doesn't offer relief. According to the latest Water Exploitation Index, freshwater consumption has hit a record high of 5.8% of total available resources. Values above 20% are generally considered a sign of water scarcity. Cyprus faces by far the most critical situation, with a 71% use of freshwater resources, followed by Malta and Romania with 34% and 21% respectively. Latvia, Croatia, Sweden, Slovakia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Finland and Luxembourg all recorded values of the WEI+ index under 1%, indicating they were not under water stress conditions. Looking at the trend over the 2012-2022 decade, Italy reported the highest growth rate in freshwater use with an increase of nearly 7%, followed by Turkey at almost 6% and Malta at 4%. ""By mid-century, the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and drought are projected to increase over most parts of Europe"", says the European Environment Agency. ""It is therefore important that land management practices are adequately adjusted in a timely manner and that the EU and national adaptation strategies are effectively implemented."" At their latest gathering, the Med9 countries — France, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain — floated ideas to tackle drought, like smart irrigation systems, crop-protection technologies, water conservation systems, as well as genetically modified crops. But the European Investment bank has the key is to step up the recycling of wastewater. ""More than 80% of wastewater is wasted,"" said the bank's water expert Maria Diamanti. ""Wastewater is not a problem. It is a highly valuable source of water, nutrients and energy. We need to change how we treat it and make wastewater resource recovery a priority."""

Plastic production has exploded in the meantime, creating a ""pressing global environmental challenge”, according to researchers from Tsinghua University in China. The vast majority of plastics are made from virgin resin using fossil-fuel based feedstocks, which “compromise[s] the global efforts to mitigate climate change.” Their findings, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment on Thursday, add to a relatively small but growing body of research on sources of plastic pollution throughout the supply chain. An investigation last month linked more than 25 major brands using plastic packaging to fracking in America’s Permian Basin - described as a ‘carbon bomb’ for the catastrophic impact its full extraction would have on global emissions.   To create a first-of-its-kind analysis of the global plastics sector, the researchers drew on national statistics, industry reports, and international databases from 2022. They found that just 9 per cent of the 437 million tonnes of new plastic produced that year came from recycled materials. ""The global recycling rate remained stagnant [...] reflecting little improvement from previous years,"" according to authors Quanyin Tan, Khaoula Houssini and Jinhui Li.  The US - the largest consumer of plastic per capita - has one of the world’s lowest recycling rates at just 5 per cent reuse, they note. It worsened after China imposed a ban on plastic waste imports in 2018. Although the recycling rate remains stubbornly at 9 per cent, there has been a “significant shift” within waste disposal from landfill to incineration.  Landfills are still the main destination for plastic rubbish, at 40 per cent, but this share has been declining in recent years, while incineration has risen to 34 per cent.  Japan, China and the EU have among the highest incineration rates for plastic waste, accounting for 70 per cent, 60 per cent and 38 per cent respectively. In Europe’s case, this is attributed to the continent’s focus on energy recovery and waste-to-energy initiatives. Burning plastics comes with its own risks too, however, releasing harmful pollutants that require advanced technologies and a tight regulatory framework, the researchers caution. While consumers sort their waste with the best of intentions, only 38 million tonnes of the 75 million tonnes of plastic sorted and collected each year ends up being recycled. A number of factors are holding plastic recycling back, the study explains. For one, the huge array of plastic materials makes processing them difficult. Food smeared onto plastic, labels, and other kinds of contamination further impede the process at recycling facilities. From an economic point of view, virgin plastic can often be cheaper to work with than recycled plastic, largely due to fluctuating oil prices. This discourages investment in recycling infrastructure and technology, keeping recycling rates low. More should be done at the design stage too, the researchers say, to ensure products can be recycled efficiently. Plastic is integrated into all parts of our lives, but it casts a heavy environmental shadow both up and downstream.  Around 98 per cent of the virgin plastics produced around the world in 2022 was generated from fossil-fuel based feedstocks, the new study finds, including 44 per cent derived from coal, 40 per cent from petroleum and 8 per cent from fossil gas. To tackle this major source of emissions and clean up plastic pollution in the environment, the world is thrashing out a legally binding treaty on plastics. Negotiations fell apart in December but are set to resume in August in Geneva. The researchers say they hope their overview of the lifecycle of plastic will help inform a successful outcome. ""This study is yet another reminder that we cannot recycle our way out of plastic pollution,” comments Delphine Lévi Alvarès, global petrochemicals campaigner manager at the Center for International Environmental Law, who wasn’t involved in the study.  “Plastics are essentially fossil fuels in another form and serve as a critical lifeline for the fossil fuel industry. The first and most important step in addressing both plastic pollution and the climate crisis is to cut down on the production of virgin plastics."""

Fiji wants travellers to trade sundowners for something more meaningful. The Pacific Island nation’s ‘Loloma Hour’ invites visitors to spend at least one hour of their trip giving back to the environment or local communities. Whether it’s replanting mangroves, taking part in a beach clean-up or learning to make traditional crafts alongside Fijian villagers, the goal is simple: leave the islands better than you found them. “True happiness comes not just from what you take, but what you give,” says Srishti Narayan, chief marketing officer at Tourism Fiji. ‘Loloma’ is a Fijian word meaning generosity driven by love, and the new programme reflects that spirit. Rolled out across dozens of eco-minded hotels, resorts and tour operators, Loloma Hour is part of Fiji’s wider strategy to preserve its cultural heritage and natural ecosystems while creating meaningful exchanges between travellers and locals. The initiative supports activities that align with four key pillars: wildlife conservation, community support, reef protection and coastline care. Guests might join a coral planting session, participate in iguana conservation walks, take part in reef-safe snorkelling or attend a village storytelling event.  The aim is for tourists to contribute at least 5,000 volunteer hours across the country this year. Fiji’s bet on mindful travel taps into a growing trend.  According to a 2023 Booking.com survey, 76 per cent of global travellers say they want to travel more sustainably. In Europe, the demand is especially high, and operators are answering the call. Five of the 10 most sustainable destinations in 2024 were in Europe, according toLonely Planet, and destinations like the Faroe Islands and Normandyhave been praised for pioneering community-based and regenerative tourism programmes. From Thailand toGreenland, tourism boards and private operators alike have started rethinking everything frominteractions with wildlife todiving excursions to make them more purposeful. Among them, Fiji’s Loloma Hour stands out for its cultural framing – rooted in love rather than obligation. But it also has a deeper meaning. The Pacific Islands are on the frontlines of the climate crisis, pressed with rising sea levels, coral bleaching and extreme weather events. With tourism making up about 40 per cent of Fiji’s GDP, turning tourism into a tool for change isn’t just good policy. It might also be essential for the country’s future. From five-star hideaways to barefoot eco-resorts, 21 properties across Fiji are currently taking part in Loloma Hour – each offering different activities.  At Six Senses Fiji, guests can swim through coral nurseries with experts, plant native trees or tour the resort’s organic gardens. The Jean-Michel Cousteau Resort offers marine education sessions led by in-house biologists. On islands like Malolo and Wakaya, guests can document vulnerable manta ray populations while diving or join mangrove replanting sessions and beach clean-ups. “Loloma Hour gives visitors a chance to help preserve what makes Fiji so special – its people, environment and traditions,” says Narayan."
47b62c15-ec10-46fa-b5b9-3b419208bf19,https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/04/14/pumped-up-pollen-how-climate-change-could-be-making-your-seasonal-allergies-worse,04.14.2025 14:18 GMT+1,Pumped up pollen: How climate change could be making your seasonal allergies worse,"Seasonal allergies are becoming more intense and protracted due to climate change, according to a new study. Warming conditions are lengthening pollen seasons around the world, researchers from the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences found. The new paper builds on previous studies that link worsening allergies in Europe with climate change and elevated concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere. The new research, published in the journal The Laryngoscope, examined studies from 2000 to 2023 to find data linking global warming with pollen production. Sixteen studies identified a link between rising temperatures and extended pollen seasons. Our changing climate is making plants shift the timings of their developmental stages, releasing the microscopic particles that enable reproduction earlier and for a longer period. Some research predicted that total pollen production in the US could increase by as much as 40 per cent by the end of the century. It also anticipates that allergy season will begin earlier, with up to 19 extra days of pollen in certain places, exacerbating conditions for allergy sufferers. Previous research has looked at the changing patterns of pollen release in Europe. A study from 2019 found that the pollen season has been extended by an average of 0.9 days per year in Europe. Research from 2014 found that in urban areas, where most Europeans live, warmer temperatures exacerbated by the urban heat island effect have led to earlier pollen season starts. Rising temperatures and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations stimulate plant growth, intensifying pollen concentrations in the air, other studies have concluded. Heightened humidity and thunderstorms during the pollen season can also increase pollen and allergen concentrations in the air, which can provoke more severe allergic reactions and asthma attacks. Global warming is facilitating the migration of new, invasive plant species to Europe, too. Ragweed, for example, arrived on the continent several decades ago, brought over with seed deliveries from North America. The plant is highly allergenic and releases pollen late in the year, in September, thus also potentially lengthening allergy season. The effects of climate change on pollen season will increase allergy suffering, even for originally weak allergens. Under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) medium greenhouse gas emissions scenario, ragweed sensitisation is expected to increase by up to 200 per cent in some European countries by 2050, according to a 2017 study published in Environmental Health Perspectives. People already sensitive to pollen are expected to experience more severe and prolonged allergic symptoms, which can exacerbate respiratory problems and increase mortality for asthma sufferers. The researchers from George Washington University hope that the pressure on medical professionals to understand the impact of the climate on allergic conditions in order to prepare patients for rising pollen levels can be beneficial for the planet, too. “Physicians are uniquely positioned to witness the impact of allergic rhinitis on patient outcomes and can adapt their practice as climate change intensifies,” lead author Alisha R. Pershad said. “As trusted voices in the community, they should leverage their frontline experience to advocate for meaningful change in addressing the climate crisis.”"

Parliament’s lower house, the Bundestag, said on Monday that Speaker Julia Klöckner is preparing to call the session early next month. Merz's centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU), its sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) last week reached an agreement to form a government more than six weeks after Germany's snap federal election. The would-be coalition aims to spur economic growth, boost defence spending, take a tougher approach to migration and catch up on long-neglected modernisation. Combined, the three parties have a modest majority of 328 out of 630 seats in the Bundestag. Since no party wants to work with the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) — which finished second in the 23 February election — no other plausible combination of governing parties has a parliamentary majority. Both the CDU and the SPD — the party of the departing chancellor, Olaf Scholz — need to approve the coalition agreement before parliament can gather to elect Merz. The CSU approved it last week. The SPD is set to hold a member vote, whilst the CDU will vote during a party conference slated for 28 April. There is some resistance in the SPD's ranks after the party finished third in February with its worst post-war result in a national parliamentary election. The party’s youth branch, Jusos, has come out against the deal. The faction represents around one-fifth of the SPD's approximately 358,000 members. One sticking point is Germany's minimum wage, which the SPD campaigned to increase to €15 per hour by 2026. The current minimum wage is €12.82 per hour. Merz has said that an increase in the minimum wage was not guaranteed through the coalition agreement. Despite the dispute, SPD co-leader Lars Klingbeil said on Sunday that the majority of the party's members recognised the need to form a stable government. “There are always alternatives. ... One alternative is new elections, one alternative is perhaps a minority government,"" Klingbeil told ARD television. But in today’s troubled times, ""Germany must be a place of stability,"" he added. ""For that, we need a stable democratic government, and we have presented a sensible coalition agreement for that."""

In one of the most significant shake-ups to air travel in decades, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has announced plans to eliminate paper boarding passes and check-in as we know it.  Instead, passengers could use a digital travel credential - stored on their smartphones - to move through airports using facial recognition. Developed by the ICAO, the UN agency that sets global aviation standards, the digital credential would be used alongside facial recognition to replace physical documents throughout the airport, from bag drop to the boarding gate. Travellers would download a “journey pass” that updates automatically if any changes occur, such as a flight delay or cancellation. Trials of these novel solutions are already taking off. Countries such as Finland have already launched a DTC pilot programme, while airports have experimented with the use of this emerging technology. Singapore’s Changi has expanded its biometric lanes, and in 2019, Amsterdam’s Schiphol introduced facial recognition technology for boarding on select flights. Airlines have also begun to embrace digitalisation. As soon as November this year, Ryanair has announced plans to scrap paper boarding passes. The plan comes as airlines and airports seek to streamline operations and reduce costs, especially as global travel continues its post-pandemic rebound. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the number of air passengers is expected to double to eight billion by 2040. That surge will place pressure on airports to process passengers more efficiently. Digital IDs are seen as a key solution to that growing challenge. But there’s another motivator: security. The ICAO says the new system could help crack down on identity fraud and human trafficking by providing a more robust way to verify who’s flying.  By relying on biometric data, which is unique to each person, the system promises greater accuracy than paper-based documentation can provide on its own. Valérie Viale, director of product management for travel technology company Amadeus, told The Times that these changes could be the most consequential since the adoption of e-ticketing in the early 2000s. “The industry has now decided it’s time to upgrade to modern systems that are more like what Amazon would use,” she said. If the plans develop as the ICAO envisions, boarding passes are only the beginning. Even passports could become a thing of the past in the future. Despite digitalisation being a boon to traveller convenience, not everyone is on board. Critics have voiced concerns about privacy, surveillance and data breaches. Others have decried the lack of transparency around the technologies being deployed. For its part, Amadeus has sought to reassure travellers. The company has said that its newly developed system will wipe passenger data within 15 seconds of contact with any “touchpoint,” such as baggage drop or pre-security checks. And the ICAO insists that developing a digital travel credential remains optional for every nation. That means you can keep your passport and boarding passes on hand for now. But don’t be surprised if your smartphone or face soon becomes your ticket to fly."

The Commission said it plans to recruit a range of different profiles, from legal and policy officers to data scientists and researchers, and is keeping applications open until 10 May. In a report published last month, the Commission said it hired 51 staff members in 2024 to work on the DSA but admitted that the “recruitment procedures took longer than foreseen and resulted in a yearly lower average amount of full-time contracts than forecasted.” A spokesperson for the Commission said there are now 127 staff members working on the DSA. ""The new recruitments aims to support the ongoing cases, as well as the general enforcement of the DSA,"" the spokesperson added. The aim is to grow to 200 by the end of this year. The DSA applied to all online platforms in the EU in February of last year.  The 25 largest platforms – those with more than 45 million users on average per month, including Google, Amazon, Meta, Shein and X – are supervised by the Commission, while those falling below that threshold remain the responsibility of the member states.  Since the DSA came into force, the Commission has opened investigations into X, Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, AliExpress and Temu. None of these probes have been closed yet.  The most advanced investigation is into X for an alleged lack of transparency and accountability requirements, preliminary findings published last July showed. The Republican US government that took office in January has criticised what it describes as the harmful impact of the EU’s online platforms rules, and technology legislation in general, as discriminatory non-tariff barriers to trade.  Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Committee told an audience at Mobile World Congress in February, that the DSA is ""an attack on free speech"". In an interview with Euronews, EU Tech Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said that the digital rules are “fair” because they apply to all platforms. “We have the same rules for European companies, American companies, and Chinese companies,” she said."

Last year, the DPC filed court proceedings against the social media company for violating privacy rights when the platform quietly changed its data settings to automatically opt in to training its new AI model, which competes with OpenAI’s Chat GPT and Google’s Gemini. X then vowed to stop the data processing, after which it became available in the EU. However, the DPC appears not to be satisfied with the changes. It said in a statement, made public late on Friday that “the Inquiry will examine compliance with a range of key provisions of the GDPR, including with regard to the lawfulness and transparency of the processing."" Earlier this month, Euronews reported that the Irish watchdog is also in discussions with Meta-owned messaging app Whatsapp over the introduction of the AI feature MetaAI. Several tech platforms, including Google, Meta and X have rolled-out AI features in Europe in recent weeks, claiming that the introduction in the EU took longer due to regulatory difficulties. If found guilty of a GDPR-breach, X could face a fine of up to 20 million euros, or up to 4 % of its total global turnover, whichever is higher."

Don't panic if you see a student with her hair completely electrified by static electricity in one of the electrical workshops offered by the museum, or a group of young people playing table football against a robot, and losing the game. ""Science is very abstract and many people are afraid of it. Our idea is to bring it closer to the public and see how we can interact with science, touch it, smell it, listen to it,"" explains Nancy Racké, director general of the Luxembourg Science Center. The 7,500 visitors who come every year are the stars of this museum, which has nearly 100 interactive exhibitions and spectacular workshops guided by scientific mediators who are experts in each of the subjects. Our visit coincided with that of the International School of Differdange. Twenty young people aged 13-14 years enter the interactive exhibition area with smiles on their faces.  A group of students approach the plasma ball, one of the largest in the world. They place their hand on the glass and see how the electric field is altered, forming thick beams that are directed towards their hands. Another group of pupils run to play table football against a robot. When we go over to watch the game, the screen shows a 3 for the robot and a 0 for the humans. Others are played in the Augmented Reality sandbox, where they can shape and view topographical levels. Others try putting their fingers on electrically conductive plates that give them a small electric shock. This is a high voltage experience! ""I would like to bring my friends because it is a very good experience. We learn and have fun. We can study at school, but we can't study and have fun at the same time, so it's great when we come,"" says Tommy Bianchi-Torraile, one of the students at the International School of Differdange. Each of the experimental stations has a touch screen in five languages (English, French, German, Luxembourgish, Portuguese and German) explaining the experience, its history and use. We accompanied the pupils to a chemistry workshop with one of the mediators. They listen attentively to explanations about plastics and polymers. ""This workshop prepares us for the chemistry exam we will have soon, we learn in a more fun way. We remember concepts more easily through experiences because it allows us to visualise the issues and helps us understand them better,"" says Tommy Bianchi-Torraile. Julien Laigle is the scientific mediator with expertise in astronomy. He never stops working because the EU-funded planetarium at the Luxembourg Science Center is one of the main attractions. It allows us to travel the Universe without the need for a telescope or good weather.  Julien Laigle tells us that children are the most excited about it. ""You get very positive feedback and that makes it a very rewarding job,"" he explains excitedly.

In addition to families from all the central European countries - France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands - the museum is visited every day by several schools with children and young people of different ages, from 6 years upwards.  Science has generally been seen as ""dull"" because it was taught with formulas, demonstrations and mathematics, explains Pascal, but the Luxembourg Science Center and schools want to reverse this way of learning about science.  In this museum there is a part of independent exploration by the students thanks to the touch screens with information in five languages, but ""a scientific mediator can accompany them and go deeper into the more complex explanations on specific subjects, as the teacher is usually more general"".  In addition to exploration, the Luxembourg Science Center offers a number of workshops and shows led by science mediators. The museum offers workshops in various subjects such as optics, electricity, mathematics, physics and chemistry, among others. The centre's mediators are specialised in a scientific field.  ""Today we came to a workshop on polymers, where they looked at the topic of plastics: what are they? How can they be recycled? Can we limit their use? What are the alternatives,"" says Pascal. We are trying to awaken the curiosity of the pupils in relation to questions that have to do with our daily lives,"" he explains. ""So we train citizens, not just scientists"".  There are experiences that cost millions of euros, such as the planetarium or the fog room. ""These are experiences that a school could not offer,"" says Pascal. The teacher stands in front of the fog room and explains to his students how it works. ""This camera makes it possible to see the trajectory of radioactive particles invisible to the eye"".  As for the impact on students' decision to go into science, ""we have to be honest, we are not just going to train scientists,"" says Waechter. ""In a class, there may only be 10 to 15 per cent of students who are science-oriented, if we can increase this number a little bit, that's great,"" says the teacher.  ""As not everyone is going to be a scientist, the development of general knowledge is really vital for me. Therefore, the aim of the science centre is not only to motivate people to become scientists.  But we need science in our daily lives. It is really important to make the right choices as citizens and as consumers, he argues. ""So that's the mission of our teaching: to try to encourage students to think critically and ask questions,"" concludes Pascal Waechter. "

China’s Foreign Ministry made the comment as government-appointed managers raced to prevent British Steel from shutting down the last two blast furnaces in Britain that make so-called virgin steel from raw materials. Parliament on Saturday passed legislation authorising the government to take control of the company and its Scunthorpe steelworks from Jingye Group, which has owned British Steel since 2020. Jingye still owns the company but British authorities have taken control of day-to-day operations. “We hope the British government treats Chinese enterprises investing and operating in the UK fairly and justly, protects their legitimate rights and interests, and avoids politicising and over-securitising economic and trade cooperation, so as not to affect the confidence of Chinese enterprises in investing and cooperating in the UK,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said during the weekly press conference in Beijing. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman, Dave Pares, said on Monday that while Jingye still owns the Scunthorpe works in northeastern England, nationalisation is “a likely option in the short term”. In the longer term, the government hopes to find a private investor, he added. British Steel on Monday announced the appointment of a new executive team focused on ensuring “consistent and professional leadership” of Scunthorpe. Two longtime British Steel executives, Allan Bell and Lisa Coulson, were named as the company’s interim chief executive and chief commercial officer. The appointments were approved by Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds. Bell, who has worked at the Scunthorpe steelworks for 14 years, said his main goal was to ensure continued steel production at the plant. “Our immediate priorities are securing the raw materials we need to continue blast furnace operations, ensuring we have the dedicated personnel to run those furnaces, and maintaining the highest levels of health and safety for our workforce,” Bell said in the statement. Starmer on Saturday took the dramatic step of recalling Parliament from its spring recess to pass emergency legislation authorising the government to take control of British Steel. Authorities were concerned about the plant’s future after Jingye stopped ordering the iron ore and coking coal needed to keep the furnaces operating. Once blast furnaces are shut down, it is difficult and expensive to restart them, raising concerns that Britain might lose the ability to make high-quality virgin steel needed by builders and railroads as the government tries to spur economic growth. Other British steelmakers are already in the process of shifting to electric arc furnaces that make steel from scrap metal. Pares said the government is now confident the plant will receive the raw materials it needs to keep operating for the time being. Shipments of iron ore pellets and coking coal have arrived at the port in Immingham and will reach Scunthorpe, about 20 miles (32 kilometres) away, in the coming days, he told reporters in London."

Starting late last week, the RSF and allied militias launched multiple assaults over several days on the Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps and the nearby city of el-Fasher — the capital of North Darfur province. The violence destroyed shelters, markets, and healthcare facilities in famine-hit camps hosting more than 700,000 people, NGOs said. El-Fasher is the last major city in the region still under the control of the Sudanese army, which has been fighting the RSF since Sudan descended into civil war two years ago. On Sunday, the RSF said in a statement that it had deployed units to ""secure civilians and humanitarian medical workers"" after it had ""fully liberated the Zamzam camp"". UN Humanitarian Coordinator Clementine Nkweta-Salami said in a statement on Saturday that at least 100 civilians were killed in Abu Shouk and Zamzam camps, including more than 20 children and nine aid workers. An army-aligned faction led by Darfur Governor Minni Minnawi on Sunday put the death toll at more than 400, although that number has not been independently verified. ""This represents yet another deadly and unacceptable escalation in a series of brutal attacks on displaced people and aid workers in Sudan,"" Nkweta-Salami said. Aid agency Relief International said on Sunday that nine of its staff ""were mercilessly killed including doctors, referral drivers and a team leader"" in the assault on Zamzam. The RSF denied targeting civilians and accused the military of using Zamzam as ""a military barracks, and innocent civilians as human shields"". The army has not commented. Earlier last week, NGOs reported that the RSF had also killed 56 civilians over two days of attacks in Um Kadadah, a town seized by the paramilitary group en route to el-Fasher. Sudan was plunged into chaos in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the army and the RSF exploded into open warfare across the nation. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and at least 12 million displaced, and a humanitarian crisis is worsening. Late last month, the Sudanese military regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war. But the RSF still controls most of Darfur and parts of southern Sudan. The conflict has been marked by atrocities committed by both the army and the RSF, including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings, that may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the UN and international rights groups. The respective leaders of the army and the RSF — General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is better known as Hemedti — have been sanctioned by the US over the abuses. Washington has also accused the RSF of committing genocide. Both the military and the RSF have strongly denied the accusations. On Tuesday, the second anniversary of the civil war, foreign ministers from nearly 20 countries will meet in London for a conference that aims to bring an end to the conflict."

Latest advice after Storm Olivier sweeps through Canary Islands,"Torrential rain and thunderstorms have battered the Canary Islands since Storm Olivier made landfall on the Spanish archipelago last Wednesday. The island of Lanzarote bore the brunt of the intense weather, with flooding affecting several tourist hotspots. With the Easter break just around the corner, the storm might impact holiday plans. European governments have updated their travel advice for tourists in the Canary Islands and with upcoming trips. Here’s what you need to know about safety and travel insurance. Storm Olivier has swept through the Canary Islands, leaving hotels, houses and roads in Lanzarote inundated with water. As much as 60 litres of rain drenched the island in two hours on Saturday 12 April. According to the Island Emergency Consortium, the tourist towns of Costa Teguise, San Bartolomé, and Arrecife on the east coast of Lanzarote were the worst affected. Video footage shows vehicles semi-submerged on flooded roads and streams that have turned into dangerous rapids. The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has updated its travel advice for visiting the island. “Heavy rainfall and flooding in Lanzarote occurred earlier today (13 April 2025), with Costa Teguise, San Bartolomé, and Arrecife particularly affected,” the latest guidance reads. “Services across the island are affected. Some hotels are currently without power. Some roads are currently affected by mud.” It urges travellers in Lanzarote or with upcoming trips to follow the advice of the local authorities and monitor local weather updates. Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a general travel alert for Spain. “Spain can at times experience extreme weather conditions, including flooding, which can adversely affect travel plans. You can monitor information and alerts, including severe weather warnings, on the website of the Spanish Meteorological Agency, AEMET,” the update reads. “Citizens are advised to check the latest weather information before they travel and to follow the advice of the local authorities.” After some disruption last week, Lanzarote Airport is now operating as normal, with flights running on time. The Canary Islands government lifted the state of emergency in Lanzarote - declared on Saturday - at 7am on Sunday. “Following the end of the flooding caused by rain on April 12 in the municipalities of Arrecife, Teguise, and San Bartolomé on the island of Lanzarote, the island emergency situation has ended,” it said in an update. The other islands in the archipelago, including holiday spots Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura, seem to be relatively unscathed. Cloudy skies and light rain are forecast for the rest of the day. As foreign governments have not issued ‘no-go’ travel warnings for the Canary Islands, you are not automatically entitled to a refund if you cancel your trip - referred to as ‘disinclination to travel’. Reimbursement is only likely if your flight is cancelled by the airline or your accommodation is closed due to the flooding. If you have booked with a travel agent or tour operator, contact the company directly to understand your options. Some insurance policies include natural disaster cover for an event that prevents travellers from reaching their holiday destination. You should read the terms and conditions carefully and talk to your provider for advice."

In case you missed it, Trump somehow managed to slap 10 per cent tariffs on an Australian territory with no human inhabitants: the Heard and McDonald Islands, home to penguins and seals.   Just penguins and seals.    As reported last week, the penguins from the islands have mounted a resistance in the form of a social media account and a trending hashtag #PenguinsAgainstTrump.   Now, not willing to stop flipping the bird in Trump’s direction, a new phase of the resistance begins. A non-profit has declared that penguins will be having a “protest march” on Wednesday 16 April against Trump’s tariffs.  There are some sentences you don’t expect to write, but there we are. It's come to this and we're here for it. To prove they’re very serious, Penguins International - an organisation dedicated to penguin conservation and research, who consider penguins the “true sentinels of the health of our planet” - have released this campaign video:   Penguins International will livestream the Antarctic penguins’ annual migration from the ocean to their breeding grounds, calling the event the ‘Protest March of the Penguins’ - a cheeky reference to the stunning 2005 French documentary by Luc Jacquet.  David Shutt, the non-profit’s executive director, said: “Wild penguins, like those that inhabit the Heard and McDonald Islands, face threats that are far more real than the tariffs that were imposed. Today, nine of the 18 species of penguins that exist are either listed as vulnerable or endangered of becoming extinct.”  He added: “We’re grateful to be able to use the unexpected attention on the Antarctic penguins to shine a light on the species as a whole, and to turn this news story into an opportunity to protect them for the greater good of the planet.”  Ice-solutely amazing.   Apologies. We'll do better. The protest march will be livestreamed on the non-profit’s YouTube channel on Wednesday 16 April. Oh, and a timely reminder while we're at it: World Penguin Day is on 25 April."

Brussels has for years been concerned about the increasing number of its citizens detained by Iran on ""spurious grounds,"" many of whom it says ""continue to be held in degrading conditions with no chance of a fair trial."" In response, EU foreign ministers imposed asset freezes and travel bans on three judges, two prosecutors and two prison officials, including Hedayatollah Farzadi, who is in charge of the notorious Evin Prison in Tehran, which was previously targeted with sanctions. The bloc claims that Farzadi is ""directly responsible for severe violations of political prisoners’ human rights, in particular for restricting their communication and visitation rights and for arbitrarily ordering solitary confinement."" The EU also froze the assets of Shiraz Central Prison. ""Several hostages from European countries have been unlawfully detained in this prison, where their access to a fair trial has been denied and where they have experienced severe violations of their most basic rights,"" the EU said. The first branch of the Revolutionary Court of Shiraz in Fars province was targeted too, with Brussels noting its role in ""unjust trials and executions of political dissidents and persecution of individuals from minority communities."" French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot welcomed the sanctions, describing Iran’s actions as ""a state policy"" of hostage taking. ""It's high time because the conditions in which some of our French and European compatriots are being detained are disgraceful and comparable to torture under international law,"" Barrot told reporters. He warned French citizens to avoid traveling to Iran. Last month, Frenchman Olivier Grondeau, who was imprisoned in Iran for over 880 days, was freed along with another French citizen who had been under house arrest in the capital for more than four months. An Iranian court had sentenced Grondeau, a backpacker, to five years in prison on espionage charges that he, his family and the French government vigorously denied. He was held at Evin Prison, which holds Westerners, dual nationals and political prisoners often used by Iran as bargaining chips in negotiations with the West. And in December last year, Italian journalist Cecilia Sala was arrested and imprisoned for three weeks, just days after Iranian businessman Mohammad Abenini was detained in Milan on a US arrest warrant. She was ultimately released and returned to Italy in January."

Speaking with ARD's Caren Miosga on Sunday, Merz made it clear that he stood by his past calls to give the Ukrainian military the long-range weapons. The suggestion breaks with the policy of the incumbent German leader Olaf Scholz, who has refused to give Ukraine the missiles. Merz's comments came after a Russian missile attack — which he called ""a serious war crime"" — left at least 34 civilians dead and 117 wounded in the Ukrainian city of Sumy. The German chancellor-in-waiting explained his position on the Taurus missiles by saying that the Ukrainian military needs to be able to “get ahead of the situation"". However, Merz stressed that the delivery of long-range missiles would only happen after consultations with Germany's European allies. ""That has to be coordinated. And if it is agreed, then Germany should participate,"" said Merz, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Merz noted that German allies such as the British and the French have already been supplying the Ukrainians with cruise missiles. However, the Taurus system offers a greater range than the French Scalp cruise missile or the British Storm Shadow missile. It also has the necessary precision to effectively destroy critical targets such as bridge piers. The incoming German chancellor mentioned that it could be used to target the Kerch Bridge, the most important land link between Russia and the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula. ""That would be one way of finally putting this country strategically — to stay with the term — ahead of the situation,"" explained Merz, adding that he was not convinced that ""Putin would react positively to weakness and peace offers"". Ukraine has been demanding the delivery of German Taurus cruise missiles for years, primarily in order to be able to target strategically important infrastructure such as the Kerch Bridge. The bridge has been attacked several times during the war but not fully destroyed. Chancellor Scholz has always rejected the delivery of Taurus missiles, fearing that Germany could become a party to the war if it sends Kyiv the weapons. The policy of the outgoing SPD chancellor has been criticised by Ukraine. It is unclear if Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SPD), which has agreed to form a coalition government with the CDU, will support Merz's stance on the issue."

Defence Minister Nikos Dendias signed the deal in Athens on Monday alongside his French counterpart, Sébastien Lecornu, during his official visit to the Greek capital.  While the ministers did not disclose the value of the contract, it marks a continuation of Greece’s growing defence ties with France. “Greece does not threaten, but is threatened,” Dendias said in a joint statement to the press, referring to Greece’s fraught relationship with Turkey, with whom it has long-standing disputes over territorial boundaries in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean.  The two NATO allies have come close to military conflict several times in recent decades. The missile acquisition adds to Greece's broader modernisation programme, which was launched following years of defence spending cuts during the 2010–2018 financial crisis.  Previous procurements from France include 24 Rafale fighter jets and three Belharra-class frigates. Dendias noted that discussions are ongoing regarding the potential addition of a fourth frigate, while France is also supplying NH-90 military helicopters. Athens plans to invest €25 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces and adapt to new forms of high-tech warfare.  Speaking in parliament earlier this month, Dendias outlined a shift away from conventional systems toward a more agile and technologically advanced military model — incorporating AI-powered missile networks, drones and mobile command units. The defence overhaul spans all branches of the armed forces and reflects Greece’s strategic alignment with key partners, including France, Israel and the US."

The piece was offered by Forum Auctions at a presale estimate of £20,000 (€23,152) and eventually went to the museum after a bidding war. Manuscripts by the Brontë sisters – writers Charlotte, Emily and Anne – often go up for sale but pictural artworks are more uncommon. “It was very tense when lot 53, Emily Brontë’s painting, came up, as the likelihood was that it would disappear into a private collection,” the Brontë Parsonage Museum’s principal curator Ann Dinsdale told Artnet. “The bidding seemed to go up very fast, then there was a very tense pause before the gavel came down and I knew that the painting would be coming to the Brontës’ former home in Haworth. It was a very emotional moment for staff at the museum.” The watercolour, titled 'The North Wind', is a portrait of a young woman with brown, wind-swept hair wearing a white dress and a blue cloak. It is a copy of an engraving by William Finden, which appeared his 1833 ""Illustrations of the Life and Works of Lord Byron."" Emily Brontë completed this artwork in 1842, when she was around 24 years old and studying in Brussels with her sister Charlotte, the author of “Jane Eyre.” Charlotte’s letters mention that Emily had taken drawing lessons while in Belgium and is likely to have left behind some of her work when she returned to England. According to the auction catalogue, 'The North Wind' was probably retained by Constantin Héger, who ran the boarding school where the Brontë sisters studied, and possibly passed the artwork to his descendants. Apart from her celebrated Victorian novel “Wuthering Heights”, few of Emily Brontë’s pieces survive. Her pictural work is particularly unknown. “Unlike Charlotte and Branwell, Emily left few drafts, few exercises, to tell the story of her apprenticeship in painting”, Jane Sellars and Christine Alexander wrote in their 1995 book “The Art of the Brontës.” “Her drawings and rough sketches are as fragmentary, and as elusive of interpretation, as her surviving poetry... Judging by surviving examples, Emily made fewer copies of engravings than her siblings.” Among the Brontë siblings, Branwell was especially known for his paintings and produced many of the surviving images of his sisters. Emily Brontë’s watercolour will be assessed by a conservator and is then expected to go on permanent public display at the Brontë Parsonage Museum in West Yorkshire."

The company unveiled the price hikes of at least 10%, saying it was a “tough decision” driven by the “backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates.” The recommended retail price for a PS5 Digital Edition will go up to €499 in Europe, according to a post on Sunday on the official PlayStation blog. That’s up from €449 in a previously announced pricing update in 2022. In the United Kingdom, the new price will be £430 (€498.3), up from £389 (€450.7) previously while in Australia the price will increase to AUD 749(€415.7) from AUD 649 (€360.2). The price in New Zealand will rise to NZD 859 (€442.9). The PS5 Digital Edition is a slimmed-down version of the console that comes without a disc drive. Sony said the price in Europe and the UK for the standard PlayStation 5, which was released in 2020 and comes with a Blu-ray Disc drive, will remain unchanged, as will the price for the PS5 Pro version, which was released last year. US President Donald Trump’s move earlier this month to impose tariffs on nations around the world has roiled global manufacturing supply chains. An announcement over the weekend of electronic imports like smartphones and laptops getting a temporary reprieve until the US government decides on a new tariff approach tailored to the semiconductor industry has further confused exporters. With the US market being the biggest one for video game consoles, a PlayStation 5 price increase in the US could have significant consequences for Sony's revenues. Referring to the US, Christopher Dring, editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Game Business, said, as reported by the BBC: ""Rather than simply increase prices there, it's possible the likes of PlayStation could increase pricing globally in an effort to protect, as best they can, the US market."" He added: ""Ultimately, the era when game consoles went down in price over time is certainly over."" Sony's price hike also comes as rival Nintendo recently revealed that its Switch 2 console launch would be delayed indefinitely, while the company assesses demand. Nintendo will also suspend US pre-orders for the Switch 2, in order to be able to monitor evolving market conditions and the impact of tariffs. The price increase comes as Nintendo's launch of its rival Switch 2 console was marred by the impact of US tariffs on markets worldwide."

Ulla Müller, who leads the UNFPA team in Ukraine, warned of the escalating dangers faced by women living in the country and said gender-based violence is worsening.  Violence against women tends to increase in conflict situations as instability exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, Müller told Euronews.   ""Gender-based violence is the shadow of the crisis that no one talks about. That has to end,” she said, adding that it is a topic people tend to ignore because it is ugly, and no one wants to recognise it.   UNFPA reports that insecurity for women in the region is rising alongside growing tensions arising from the conflict.  ""War does not allow women to move safely around the community and many areas of their cities, due to the electricity cuts and bombings,” she said, asking where vulnerable women could turn to if they also feel unsafe at home.  An estimated 2.4 million people in Ukraine—mostly women and girls—are experiencing or are at risk of gender-based violence and need support services, according to the United Nations Ukraine Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan 2025.  UNFPA’s report Voices from Ukraine gathers testimonies from women on the ground affected by gender-based violence and provides recommendations to strengthen protection and support.  ""Unless we tell the world how ugly this is and how it is for women, it will not change,” Müller stressed.  Stress from insecurity and displacement, the pressures of war, economic hardship, power outages, and unemployment are among the risk factors identified by the agency as fuelling violence against women.  ""The fact is that when men return from war, they are also hurt and they have changed, but also families have changed,” Müller said of difficulties families encounter when soldiers return from the frontline.   “They don't know each other anymore and that combined with the mental trauma, that is also a collective one, leads to an increase in gender-based violence,"" she added.   Coping mechanisms such as alcohol and drug use to manage pain and trauma further contribute to the rise in violence, the agency warned.  The prevailing narrative that glorifies returning soldiers as “heroes” can also discourage women from speaking out, the report noted.  ""We have a situation where it's shameful to talk about it for women because this is the hero returning and you don't really want to change that image,” argued Müller.   This, together with fear of isolation, the insecurity caused by the war, and difficulties in securing housing, often prevents women from leaving abusive situations.  According to Müller, this situation requires a systematic approach that Ukraine is struggling to prioritise amid the ongoing war.   “The resources are scarce and what is really important to understand is that the government, for good reason, has a focus on the war and protecting and safeguarding the mere existence of Ukraine,” she stressed, adding the country also needs support to rebuild its society.   As Ukraine works to reconstruct damaged infrastructure and rebuild areas destroyed by Russian attacks, Müller believes this presents an opportunity to reshape society with women’s safety and needs in mind.  She stressed the importance of practical measures, such as ensuring street lighting near bus stops, supermarkets, and schools, to support women’s mobility.  Since the onset of the war, Ukraine has experienced regular power outages that have forced citizens to adapt their work, routines, and social lives.  According to data published on the Energy Map portal electricity outages lasted almost 2,000 hours in 2024.  UNFPA is urging the Ukrainian government and local authorities to implement public safety measures to reduce the risk of violence and increase the sense of security.  Investment in street lighting, accessible infrastructure and transport, and a greater presence of police and surveillance cameras in public spaces, they point out, could improve the situation for women across the country.

The decision to expel the officials comes just days after prosecutors in France indicted three Algerians, including a consular official, on suspicion of kidnapping the Algerian influencer Amir Boukhors last year. Boukhors, who has a large TikTok following, is a critic of the Algerian government, which wants him to return to face trial for alleged fraud and terror offences. Amir DZ — as he better known online — was abducted last April in a suburb of Paris, before being released the following day, according to his lawyer. Barrot said the expulsion of diplomats was directly linked to the case of Boukhors, who has lived in France since 2016 and was granted political asylum there in 2023. ""This decision would be a response to the arrest of three Algerian nationals suspected of serious offences on French national territory,"" Barrot said. The French foreign minister has urged Algiers to reconsider the expulsions, saying that Paris would be forced to retaliate if it does not. ""I am asking Algerian authorities to abandon these expulsion measures. If the decision to send back our officials is maintained, we will have no other choice but to respond immediately,"" Barrot said. Although relations between France and its former colony have long been challenging, tensions worsened dramatically last July when French President Emmanuel Macron recognised the autonomy of Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty. Since then, the countries have clashed over other events including the detention of the French-Algerian author Boualem Sansal in Algiers in November. Last month, Sansal, 80, was given a five-year prison sentence for allegedly undermining national unity. Macron has called for his release, calling on the Algerian authorities to demonstrate ""common sense and humanity."" There has also been sharp disagreement over France's attempts to deport Algerians it deems a threat. However, before Algeria's decision to expel French officials, it appeared that relations between the two countries were improving. Barrot suggested earlier this month that ties were ""back to normal"" following a call between Macron and his Algerian counterpart Abdelmadjid Tebboune on 31 March."

Although Trump has paused most of his ""reciprocal"" tariffs, he has kept in place 145% duties on imports from China, the world’s second-largest economy. “There are no winners in a trade war, or a tariff war,” Xi wrote in an editorial jointly published in Vietnamese and Chinese official media. “Our two countries should resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.” Xi’s visit is a way for China to show Southeast Asia it is a “responsible superpower"" in the way that it approaches trade, compared to how the ""US under President Donald Trump presents to the whole world”, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at Singapore’s ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute. Xi was greeted on the tarmac by Vietnam’s President Luong Cuong at the start of his two-day visit, a mark of honour not often given to visitors, said Nguyen Thanh Trung, a professor of Vietnamese studies at Fulbright University Vietnam. Students of a drum art group performed as women waved the red and yellow Chinese and Communist Party flags. While Xi’s trip likely was planned earlier, it has become significant because of the tariff fight between China and the US. The visit offers a path for Beijing to shore up its alliances and find solutions for the high trade barrier that the US has imposed on Chinese exports. In Vietnam, Xi will meet with Vietnam’s Communist Party General Secretary To Lam, his counterpart, as well as the Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. “The trip to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia is all about how China can really insulate itself against Trump,” said Nguyen Khac Giang. He pointed out that since Xi became the president in 2013, he has only visited Vietnam twice. The timing of the visit sends a “strong political message that Southeast Asia is important to China,” said Huong Le-Thu of the International Crisis Group think tank. She said that given the severity of Trump’s tariffs and despite the 90-day pause to ""reciprocal"" duties, Southeast Asian nations were anxious that Trump's policies could hinder their development. Vietnam is experienced at balancing its relations with the US and China. It is run under a communist, one-party system like China but has had a strong relationship with Washington. In 2023, it was the only country that received both US President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping. That year it also upgraded the US to its highest diplomatic level, the same as China and Russia. Vietnam is one of the biggest beneficiaries of countries trying to decouple their supply chains from China, with many businesses choosing to relocate to Vietnam. China is still its biggest trading partner, and China-Vietnam trade surged 14.6% year-on-year in 2024, according to Chinese state media. But the intensification of the trade war has put Vietnam in a “very precarious situation” given the view in the US that Vietnam is serving as a backdoor for Chinese goods, said Giang, the analyst at Singapore’s ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute. Vietnam had been hit with 46% tariffs under Trump’s order before the 90-day pause. China and Vietnam have real long-term differences, including territorial disputes in the South China Sea, where Vietnam has faced off with China’s coast guard but does not often publicise the confrontations. After Vietnam, Xi is expected to go to Malaysia next and then Cambodia."

Insurer Ageas said the deal would allow it to save at least £100 million (€115.8mn) per year before tax, according to a statement released on Monday. The firm added that the deal will expand its reach, helping to grow its market revenue to £3.3bn (€3.8bn) by 2028. The transaction is predicted to close in the second half of this year, subject to regulatory approval. “This transaction will allow us to offer competitive value propositions to a wider customer profile via a multi-channel distribution model, positioning Ageas UK as one of the top three personal lines insurers,” CEO of Ageas Group, Hans De Cuyper, said on Monday. CEO of Esure Group, David McMillan, said in the same statement: “Combining Ageas’s scale, financial strength and excellent broker relationships with esure’s strong retail brands, market-leading data capabilities and strength on PCWs, alongside a shared technology platform, will enhance our combined ability to invest in our customer proposition and open up new opportunities for growth.” Esure, which also operates under the brand names Sheilas’ Wheels and First Alternative, was founded in 2000 and has been owned by Bain Capital since 2018. The group paid £1.2bn (€1.4bn) to end public ownership of the firm in 2018. The deal also comes after Ageas attempted to expand its UK footprint by bidding for Direct Line. The British car insurer rejected two takeover bids from Ageas, the second of which valued the firm at £3.2bn (€3.7bn), branding the offer as “unattractive” for shareholders. Direct Line is now being acquired by the UK’s largest insurer Aviva for £3.7bn (€4.3bn), a takeover Direct Line approved after rejecting the firm’s first offer. The acquisition means the combined group dominates more than 20% of the motor insurance market and 15% of the home sector. Esure said it had seen “excellent progress” in its financial report for 2024, making a turnover of £1.1bn (€1.3bn), compared to £973mn in 2023.  The company made a trading profit of around £126.8mn (€146.7mn) last year, up from a loss of £16.7mn in 2023. The deal between Esure and Ageas comes after the UK government launched an investigation into the high cost of car insurance last year, although prices have been falling in recent months."

Items up for grabs on Sunday included five Olympic torches that were used for months throughout the long relay from Olympia in Greece to the French capital in the lead-up to the Games. The torches fetched between €12,000 and €20,000 each. The auction also featured pieces from the historic opening ceremony of the Olympics. With 12 acts, torrential rain and enormous controversy surrounding the presence of drag queens, the parade created many memorable moments. The red dress worn by the performer dressed as a beheaded Marie-Antoinette, who sang a revolutionary song out the window of the Conciergerie, was sold for €832. Among the main buyers was a national sports museum from the southern French city of Nice. The institution spent €2,300 to buy the wreath and garlands of fake fruits and flowers worn by Philippe Katerine during the ceremony. The French singer had appeared from under a silvery cloche (also auctioned off), almost naked and covered in blue body paint, in a cosplay of Greek god Dionysus. The Nice museum also purchased the costume of the mysterious masked torchbearer who ran along the Seine, from one iconic monument to the next, during the ceremony. The costume was aspired by popular elements of French culture, including the Phantom of the Opera, gentleman burglar Arsène Lupin, and the video game Assassin’s Creed. The auction also showcased 20 iterations of the beloved Olympic mascot Phryge, from the little stuffed toys given to Olympic medallists to full-size costumes. One online bidder purchased two miniature Olympic and Paralympic Phryge for €3,200 and €1,408 respectively. The proceeds from the auction will be donated to three charities promoting parasport and physical exercise for hospital patients."

Two Russian ballistic missiles struck Sumy as the Christian faithful celebrated Palm Sunday, a festivity that honours Christ's entrance into Jerusalem. At least 34 people were killed and more than 110 were injured. ""The strike hit the city centre on Palm Sunday. Only filthy scum can act like this,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The attack against civilians came as Ukraine was still mourning 19 people, including nine children, who were killed in Kryvyi Rih earlier this month. Both Russian strikes bear similarities, combining ballistic missiles and cluster munitions to maximise damage. For foreign ministers, the barrage demonstrates Vladimir Putin has no interest in pursuing the peace negotiations promoted by Donald Trump. ""I just want to say how appalled I am by the latest spate of Russian attacks on Ukraine,"" Radosław Sikorski, Poland's foreign minister, said on Monday. ""I hope President Trump and the US administration see that the leader of Russia is mocking that goodwill and I hope the right decisions are taken."" Lithuania's Kęstutis Budrys said the ""barbaric attack"" on Sumy represented a ""war crime by definition"" and demanded a fresh package of sanctions targeting the sector left ""untouched"" in previous decisions, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and nuclear. The 17th package since February 2022 is believed to be in very early stages and, once presented, is expected to face Hungary's veto. Budapest has become increasingly critical of economic restrictions, going as far as threatening to block their renewal. ""This is, once again, a humiliation to everyone who puts diplomatic efforts to stop this war and achieve at least a ceasefire for negotiations to begin,"" Budrys said. ""This is the time now for us to show not only our unity but also dedication,"" he added. ""Otherwise, we're not functioning as an organisation (but) as separate countries."" His Finnish counterpart, Elina Valtonen, backed the calls for additional hard-hitting penalties and said the plunge in worldwide oil prices caused by Trump's sweeping tariffs was ""exactly"" what the West needed to weaken the Kremlin's war machine. ""Russia shows full disregard for the peace process but also that Russia has zero regard for human life,"" Valtonen said upon arrival. ""There's one person who's not interested in peace and that's Putin."" Sweden's Maria Malmer Stenergard went a step further, declaring it was time to ""move on and take the frozen assets."" The possible seizure of the Russian Central Bank's assets, which are immobilised as part of the sanctions, has been floated in the past but gained traction after Trump came into office and began reducing military assistance for Ukraine. The sheer value of the money, worth about €210 on EU soil alone, is seen as an attractive source of revenue to compensate for America's dwindling assistance. However, some member states are reluctant to make the unprecedented move, fearing negative repercussions for the bloc's financial stability and credibility for investors. Last month, European Council President António Costa poured cold water on the momentum for confiscation, arguing the assets should remain paralysed to sustain a €45-billion loan to Kyiv and ensure Moscow eventually pays for war reparations. ""That's the reason it's important to protect these assets, to (keep) these assets under control,"" Costa said in an event. Still, the debate is not over as Trump's pivot to Russia forces allies to reconsider long-held beliefs and embrace ambitious notions, such as full-scale rearmament. Reacting to the Sumy attack, the American president described it as ""horrible"" and ""terrible"" but appeared to lessen Russia's fault. Since taking office, Trump has been repeatedly accused of echoing the Kremlin's talking points. ""I was told they made a mistake,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. Foreign ministers wholeheartedly disagreed, saying the strikes were deliberate. ""I don't know what he's learning and what he's not learning, but the facts are on the ground and in the face of everyone: Russia is killing civilians and it's killing civilians on the way to the church,"" Latvia's Baiba Braže said when asked about Trump. ""It's a double whammy. Russians knew what they were doing."" High Representative Kaja Kallas, who chaired Monday's meeting in Luxembourg, added her voice to the collective outrage and endorsed the push for new sanctions. ""We have to put the pressure – the maximum pressure – on Russia to really end this war because it takes two to want peace (but) it only takes one to want war,"" Kallas said. Kallas has spent the past weeks urging member states to step up their military support for Ukraine, putting forward a plan with an ideal figure of €40 billion for 2025. The blueprint, which is based on gross national income (GNI) to ensure donations are fairly distributed, was well received by small member states but met with the resistance of bigger ones, like France and Italy, who scoffed at the mathematical formulation. Faced with political opposition, Kallas re-focused her plan on the goal to quickly gather €5 billion to deliver 2 million rounds of ammunition shells to Ukraine. According to the High Representative, two-thirds of the €5 billion have already been secured."

Since March, Washington has transferred at least 200 mostly Venezuelan immigrants it accuses of gang membership and violent crimes to El Salvador, where they are being held in a maximum-security prison just outside the capital San Salvador. The US government has offered little evidence for its claims that the immigrants are in fact gang members, nor has it released names of those deported. Lawyers and family members of the detainees say they are not part of gangs, and that they have not been granted the opportunity to contest the Trump administration's accusations in court. One of those detainees is a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose case hit headlines after US officials admitted that he was wrongly sent to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia — who was sent to the CECOT mega prison on 15 March despite an order protecting him from deportation — has not been returned to the US, even though courts have ruled he must be brought back. The Trump administration confirmed on Saturday that Abrego Garcia remains at the mega prison, but did not address the demands of the district judge handling the case to outline what measures it was taking to return him to the US. On Thursday, the Supreme Court ruled that the government must ""facilitate and effectuate"" Abrego Garcia's return. The case is expected to be discussed between the two leaders at Monday's meeting in Washington, where Bukele will likely receive a warm welcome. Trump and his inner circle have praised Bukele's government for taking ""enemy aliens"" and helping the US to ""eradicate terrorist organisations"". Over the weekend, 10 more people who the Trump administration claims are members of the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua gangs were sent to El Salvador, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Sunday. The alliance between Trump and Bukele ""has become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere,"" Rubio said. Speaking to reporters travelling on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said Bukele was doing a ""fantastic job"". ""He’s taking care of a lot of problems that we have that we really wouldn’t be able to take care of from cost standpoint,"" Trump said. ""And he’s doing really, he’s been amazing. We have some very bad people in that prison. People that should have never been allowed into our country."" Bukele remains extremely popular in El Salvador due in part to his government's three-year crackdown on the country’s powerful street gangs, which has led to more than 84,000 arrests. Rights groups have criticised the anti-gang campaign for a lack of due process, harsh prison conditions and widespread abuses in custody, such as torture. Under a deal struck between El Salvador and the US last month, Bukele's government is to receive about $6 million (€5.3 million) to imprison 300 alleged members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang. When a US federal judge last month ordered the Trump administration to turn around a flight carrying the immigrants already en route to El Salvador, Bukele wrote on social media: ""Oopsie ... too late"". The Trump administration has used the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to justify the deportations. Hundreds have been transferred under this rarely used law, which permits the deportation of nationals from countries considered hostile during times of conflict. At Monday's meeting, Bukele could also seek relief from Trump's 10% tariff, arguing that it harms the Salvadoran economy he is trying to bolster. Bukele came to power in June 2019, in Trump’s first term, and had a straightforward relationship with the US leader. Trump was most concerned with immigration and, under Bukele, the number of Salvadorans heading for the US border declined sharply."

But the current global trade turmoil could threaten that progress. European AI investment saw venture capital funding up 55 per cent in this year’s first quarter compared to the same period last year, according to new data from Dealroom analysed by Balderton Capital and shared in a first exclusive with Euronews Next.  The data showed that AI companies have already raised $3.4 billion (almost €3 billion), up from $2.2 billion (€1.9 billion) in Q1 2024. It also showed that European tech stocks, excluding AI, are down 10 per cent. However, the data does not include the effects of tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, who hit China with a 125 per cent tariff on imports.  He also struck Europe with a 20 per cent tariff rate on duty exports to the US, before being temporarily lowered to 10 per cent. Over the weekend, Trump said electronic devices such as smartphones and computers would be exempt from the US duties.  While the news eased Europe’s tech stocks on Monday morning, the path forward is still obscured, especially as Trump said on Sunday that he would announce taxes on imported semiconductors this week, which are the building blocks for AI technology.  Volatile trade environment always makes investors more risk-averse, Daria Gneusheva, an investor at German venture capital company Project A. ""Many European companies rely on components like GPUs and semiconductors from Asia and will see a price spike and disruptions in hardware procurement,"" she told Euronews Next, adding that entering US markets will also become more challenging and less attractive. However, she said that the trade war is also ""becoming a big push"" for European companies and governments to keep investing in local manufacturing and R&D. Recent tariff escalations between the US and China have also prompted companies to seek alternative markets, with Europe emerging as a strategic choice, she added. ""I wouldn’t rush yet to conclude that recent tariff development will make it better or worse for Europe, it can go both ways and it’s up to Europe to make an opportunity out of it"". Launching foundational AI models has become a geopolitical race, which nations argue is a matter of national security.  The United States and China are pushing far ahead of Europe in building foundational models, according to a recent report by Stanford University. However, Balderton noted that investment in European AI firms largely went to companies covering health, AI media, cyber security, and robotics.  The data also showed that interest in Europe’s AI agents has risen, with $52 million (€45 million) deployed to new start-ups working on these tools, including Stockholm-based firms Lovable and London-based Paid AI.  Last week, the EU’s technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen announced the AI Continent Action Plan covers infrastructure, data access, cloud, skills, and simplification and aims to transform Europe's traditional industries. It is important ""to build capacities in critical sectors” to ensure that the bloc is not dependent on other regions, she said.  ""We have identified AI as one of the sectors where we need to build our own capacity, like quantum and chips. They are key technologies for the future"". This year, there have also been two new AI unicorns, companies that have reached a valuation of $1 billion (€1 billion) without being listed on the stock market. They are Sweden’s Neko Health and Ireland’s Tines, which brings the total number of Europe’s AI unicorns to 76.  Despite being out of the European Union’s plans for AI development, the UK raised the bulk of AI investment in Europe, with around $4.2 billion (€3.6 billion) raised by British start-ups and scale-ups this year so far, $1.6 billion (€1.4 billion) went to AI companies. Germany also saw AI investment increase by 74 per cent for this year’s first quarter, compared to last year to $404 million (€355 million). However, France, whose government has pushed for investment in AI and boasts companies such as Mistral AI, has seen a dip of around 18 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared to last year.  But Balderton found that French Q1 investment overall was down 26 per cent and that AI investment was fairing better than French tech overall.  The French government has pushed for the country’s AI development and this year hosted the Paris AI Action Summit. On the eve of the event, President Emmanuel Macron announced investments worth €109 billion into AI over the next few years.  ""It's the equivalent for France of what the United States announced with Stargate,"" Macron said, referencing the US project that aims to invest $500 billion (€438 billion) in building new AI infrastructure over the next four years.  ""European AI ambition is only getting stronger. The AI Action Summit in Paris set the bar high on what needs to be done in Europe and it’s great to see that European startups and scaleups are rising to challenge,"" James Wise, partner at Balderton Capital, said in a statement.  ""From healthcare to cybersecurity and automation, European AI companies are building solutions that are desperately needed and the pace of funding demonstrates that investors are excited about the continent’s technological potential""."
804d97ac-902f-4fcf-ab70-19f3a6ae64f8,https://www.euronews.com/2025/04/14/bangladesh-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-former-uk-labour-minister-tulip-siddiq,04.14.2025 09:52 GMT+1,Bangladesh court issues arrest warrant for former UK Labour minister Tulip Siddiq,"Bangladeshi authorities have issued a warrant for the arrest of former UK minister Tulip Siddiq. The Labour MP, who resigned as economic secretary to the Treasury in January, is the niece of Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Hasina led the country for 15 years until she was removed from power last August following an uprising.  Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has been probing allegations against Hasina and her relatives, claiming that they illegally received land. Bangladeshi media reported that a judge issued the warrant for 53 people connected to Hasina, including Siddiq, Siddiq’s mother, Sheikh Rehana, and her brother, Radwan Siddiq. Lawyers for Siddiq described the charges as “politically motivated” and “completely false”. In a statement shared with Euronews, Tulip Siddiq's lawyers Stephenson Harwood said: ""The allegations are completely false and have been dealt with in writing by Siddiq's lawyers."" Siddiq has no knowledge of a hearing or an arrest warrant that was allegedly issued, Harwood added. There is no basis for the charges against the Labour MP, or truth to claims she participated in real estate-related wrongdoing in the Bangladeshi capital, according to him. ""She has never had a plot of land in Bangladesh, and she has never influenced any allocation of plots of land to her family members or anyone else."" ""No evidence has been provided by the ACC to support this or any other allegation made against Siddiq, and it is clear to us that the charges are politically motivated."" The UK classifies Bangladesh as a B2 extradition country, requiring clear evidence to act on Dhaka's warrants. Siddiq, who represents the London constituency of Hampstead and Highgate in Parliament, quit her post as the minister responsible for tackling corruption after she was named in Bangladesh's anti-corruption investigation into Hasina and her relatives. The probe alleged that Siddiq's relatives were involved in brokering a 2013 deal with Russia for a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh that involved embezzlement. The former minister said in January that she had been cleared of wrongdoing, but that the issue was becoming “a distraction from the work of the government.” Bangladesh's anti-corruption committee was contacted for comment. Hasina has been in exile in India since early August, following the mass protests that removed her from power. She fled amid an uprising that saw thousands of protesters in Bangladesh storm her residence. More than 1,400 people were killed, mostly by security forces, in the crackdowns on the anti-government protests. The UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) in February said that the former government could be guilty of crimes against humanity. The protests began with students demonstrating against a quota system for government jobs that they said was discriminatory."

The Friday evening blast caused minor damage but no injuries, following a warning call made to two media outlets approximately 40 minutes beforehand. The extremist group also said it was behind another explosive device that went off near the Labour Ministry building in the Greek capital in early February. In a lengthy statement posted online Sunday and seen by Euronews, the group said the attacks were part of an armed opposition against the state, dedicating them to “the Palestinian people and their heroic resistance”. The left-leaning organisation also referenced a man killed last year while assembling an explosive device in an Athens apartment. The group linked its actions to widespread anger over Greece’s deadliest rail disaster, which occurred in 2023 when a freight train and a passenger train were accidentally directed onto the same track near Tempi, killing 57 people and injuring dozens more.  The tragedy exposed serious safety flaws in Greece’s rail infrastructure and has sparked ongoing protests, particularly by families of the victims. “With the blood not yet dry, they attributed the accident to human error and the ‘chronic deficiencies of the Greek state,’"" the group wrote, accusing the government of using the tragedy to justify further privatisation and deregulation. Greek authorities are actively investigating the attacks, with surveillance footage and mobile phone data under review.  They noted the re-emergence of homegrown extremist groups, which have carried out low-scale bombings since the 1970s, causing damage but rarely any injuries. While older networks have been dismantled, newer factions have surfaced in recent years, representing what officials describe as a new generation of domestic extremists. Hellenic Train, which now operates as a subsidiary of Italy’s Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane following its sale in 2017, was previously part of Greece’s state-owned railway system. While the train service has been privatised, Hellenic Railways remains in charge of maintaining the railway infrastructure, including tracks and stations. In its statement, the Revolutionary Class Self-Defence has blamed the Italian company for the Tempi accident without providing any proof of its claims."

In a 180° turn of events, US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday a 90-day ""pause"" in reciprocal tariffs, except for China.

""European textile and clothing exports (to the United States, editor's note) represent around €7.5 billion a year. So if Mr Trump maintains his 20% surtax, that means €1.5 billion in customs duties"", explains Dirk Vantyghem, Director General of the European Apparel and Textile Confederation (Euratex). Italy, France and Portugal, the spearheads of the textile industry in Europe, are likely to be the European countries most affected in this sector. Haute-couture would be particularly hard hit, although some customers would be prepared to pay the extra cost, ""because it's top-of-the-range"", he adds. More worryingly, textile production in Asian countries that is not exported to the United States could, one thing leading to another, be redirected towards the European market. ""If this tariff wall is established in China, Cambodia and Vietnam, there will be a greater supply of Asian-made clothing pushed onto European markets. So the indirect impact could be even greater than the direct consequence of paying 20% customs duties on American markets"", says Dirk Vantyghem. While he does not anticipate any repercussions on prices, he does see ""a capacity problem"", which could put pressure on European manufacturers. Aware of this threat, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, declared in an interview with the Financial Times that she would not tolerate an influx of Chinese products onto the European market and that she would not hesitate to take ""safeguard measures"" if necessary. For its part, the European Apparel and Textile Confederation is calling on the Commission to favour dialogue over escalation, to avoid falling into a vicious lose-lose circle. Especially as the European textile industry has already been weakened by ""energy prices"" and the costs of complying with the European Union's strategy for sustainable and circular textiles, adopted in 2022, according to Euratex. This new situation could also reshape supply chains. Additional tariffs on Chinese products have risen to 145%. Although Donald Trump has announced a 90-day break for 75 other countries, the world's workshops have a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. If these threats are carried out, the customs duties they face will be particularly high: 37% for Bangladesh and 46% for Vietnam. ""The major European brands are looking at these customs duties and reconsidering their sourcing options"", says the Managing Director of Euratex. India and Turkey could come out on top. If applied, the surcharges would amount to 26% and 10% respectively. Some clothing companies could therefore be tempted to relocate their production there."

Jonathan Reynolds said Jingye Group, which has owned British Steel since 2020, had not been negotiating ""in good faith"" with the government in recent months over the future of the heavily loss-making steel works in Scunthorpe in the north of England. Reynolds said it had become clear on Thursday that Jingye would not accept any financial offer from the government and that it was the company's intention to close the blast furnaces ""come what may"", while keeping the more profitable steel mill operations and supplying them from China. In an interview with Sky News on Sunday, he declined to accuse the company of deliberately sabotaging the business at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party, but he did accept that there is now a ""high trust bar"" to bringing Chinese investment into the UK. ""I personally wouldn't bring a Chinese company into our steel sector,"" he said. ""I think steel is a very sensitive area."" Prime Minister Keir Starmer summoned lawmakers back to Parliament on Saturday to back a bill primarily aimed at blocking Jingye from closing the two blast furnaces. The bill, which is now law, gives Reynolds the power to direct British Steel's board and workforce, ensure its 3,000 workers get paid and order the raw materials necessary to keep the blast furnaces running. The British government had been under pressure to act after Jingye's recent decision to cancel orders for the iron pellets used in the blast furnaces. Without them and other raw materials, such as coking coal, the furnaces would likely have to shut down for good, potentially within days, as they are extremely difficult and expensive to restart once cooled. That would mean the UK, which in the late 19th century was the world's steelmaking powerhouse, would be the only country in the Group of Seven industrial nations without the capacity to make its own steel from scratch rather than from recycled material. The repercussions would be huge for industries like construction, defence and rail, and make the country dependent on foreign sources for so-called virgin steel, a vulnerability that lawmakers from all political parties balked at. In a separate interview with the BBC, Reynolds declined to give a full guarantee that British Steel will be able to secure enough raw materials in time to keep the blast furnaces going. He said he would not ""make my situation or the nation's situation more difficult"" by commenting on specific commercial details. ""If we hadn't acted, the blast furnaces were gone, steel production in the UK, primary steel producing, would have gone,"" he said. ""So we've given ourselves the opportunity, we are in control of the site, my officials are on site right now to give us a chance to do that""."

That's the question that most reporters listening to a press briefing on Wednesday by its Director-General, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, will be asking, when she presents a global trade outlook for April 2025. This month may be remembered as the moment the world stepped into a new dimension—one defined by a recalibration of global trade relations and a renewed emphasis on brute power, spearheaded by the return of US President Donald Trump and his subsequent wave of tariffs which have rippled across the globe. On 3 April, Okonjo-Iweala said those tariffs could lead to a contraction of around 1% in global merchandise trade volumes in 2025. After retaliating against total US tariffs of 145% US tariffs by bumping its own reciprocal tariffs against the US up to 125% tariffs, China announced on 11 April it will take its case to the WTO. “Bringing a case before the WTO is one option the EU will certainly be keeping on the table,” Commission’s spokesperson Olof Gill also told Euronews. The EU has been repeating since the beginning of the trade tensions with the US that it remained committed to a rules-based international economic order, which the WTO embodies. The institution governs free trade and is the multilateral body where trade disputes between nations are settled. However its dispute settlement mechanisms have been mired by since the US refused to appoint members of the WTO’s Appellate Body. The crisis affecting the smooth running of the institution was less noticed so long as the US continued to embody the spirit of free trade. But now that has changed, the WTO is looking existentially wounded. Okonjo-Iweala was the first woman and the first African to head the institution when she was appointed in 2021. Many will now be wondering whether she might add to those historic benchmarks another - could she be the last ever? NGO opacity and the Commission The European Commission’s funding of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) is “opaque” and exposes the executive to “reputational risk”, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) concluded last week following a lengthy probe. However the report was not the smoking gun that some critics were hoping for.“We did not find a single case during our audit of an NGO breaching EU values,” said the ECA member responsible for the report, Laima Andrikienė.“What they did find is a failure by the Commission and national governments to check who’s actually behind some so-called NGOs that don’t represent public interests,” said Ariel Brunner, the director of BirdLife Europe."

However, the US administration clarified that these items remain subject to the existing 20% fentanyl-related tariffs, and a special tariff on semiconductors and electronics will be introduced in around a month. Chinese authorities welcomed the decision, calling the US tariff exemption a small but constructive step toward correcting previous wrongdoings. By 8:15am CEST, the Euro STOXX 50 index – which tracks blue-chip companies across the eurozone – had risen 1.5%, while the broader Euro STOXX 600 was up 1.6%. Germany’s DAX 50 led regional performance with a 2.2% gain, followed by France’s CAC 40, which climbed 1.8%. Italy’s FTSE MIB and Spain’s IBEX 35 posted more modest increases of 1.2% and 1.0%, respectively. Investors are also awaiting first-quarter revenue figures from French luxury conglomerate LVMH, which could provide insight into consumer behaviour and the resilience of demand in the high-end sector. In macroeconomic developments, Chinese exports rose sharply by 12.4% year-on-year in March 2025, reaching USD 313.9 billion (€275.8bn). This figure significantly exceeded market expectations of a 4.4% increase and represented a steep acceleration from the 2.3% growth recorded in the January to February period. It marked the fastest expansion in overseas sales since last October, indicating a likely frontloading of shipments ahead of the anticipated implementation of new US tariffs. Among the top performers in the Euro STOXX 50 index were major European banks. Deutsche Bank gained 4.2%, BNP Paribas advanced by 4.1%, and Société Générale rose 3.5%. Dutch semiconductor giant ASML Holding also posted a strong performance, climbing 2.8%. Energy stocks were buoyed by a rebound in oil prices. Repsol increased by 3.2%, while Eni added 2.5%. In Germany’s DAX index, alongside Deutsche Bank, Sartorius rose by 3.6%, Puma added 3%, and Fresenius Medical Care also gained 3%. In the French market, STMicroelectronics surged by 6.5%, reflecting strong investor confidence. In Italy, Tenaris and Saipem both climbed 4%. The euro rallied to 1.14 against the greenback, retesting Friday’s highs and aligning with its strongest levels since February 2022. The move was driven by ongoing dollar weakness in the foreign exchange market. Chris Turner, analyst at ING, noted that “the dollar continues to trade on a weak footing”, and raised the possibility that currency policy may feature in upcoming trade negotiations led by Scott Bessent with Japan and China. Luca Cigognini, Market Strategist at Intesa Sanpaolo, commented that a break above 1.14 would open the door for a move toward 1.1500, the level last seen in early 2022. He also added that the trade war initiated by President Trump is favouring defensive currencies and undermining the “dollar’s traditional role as a safe haven”. The European Central Bank is scheduled to meet on Thursday to decide on interest rates. Market participants remain divided over whether Frankfurt will opt to hold rates steady or implement a cut. Meanwhile, eurozone bond yields declined. German two-year yields fell by five basis points to 1.78%, while the 10-year Bund yield dropped three basis points to 2.55%. Gold futures edged 0.2% lower after the precious metal had reached record highs against the dollar last Friday, briefly surpassing $3,200 (€2,830) per ounce."

With 92% of all ballots counted, the 37-year-old conservative incumbent led his leftist opponent, the lawyer Luisa González, by 55.8% to 44%. National Electoral Council President Diana Atamaint said the results showed an “irreversible trend” in favour of Noboa. However, González, whose political project is tied to the divisive ex-President Rafael Correa, has refused to accept the result of Sunday's election. ""We are going to demand a recount,"" González told her supporters in Quito. Noboa, who assumed the presidency in November 2023 after a snap election, criticised González for calling the result into question. “I find it embarrassing that with an 11- or 12-point difference, they come out to question the will of the Ecuadorians,” Noboa said. “Ecuadorians have already spoken, now we have to get to work,"" he added. Sunday's election followed a tight first-round vote in February, which Noboa won by fewer than 17,000 votes. Both Noboa and González's campaigns focused heavily on their plans to tackle the country's recent spike in violence, which is linked to the trafficking of cocaine from neighbouring Colombia and Peru. They promised tough-on-crime policies, better equipment for law enforcement and international help to fight drug cartels and local criminal groups. Noboa, who is heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, declared Ecuador to be in a state of “internal armed conflict” in January 2024, allowing him to deploy thousands of soldiers to the streets to combat gangs and to charge people with terrorism counts for alleged ties to organised crime groups. His opponents have criticised him for what they see as a string of authoritarian moves. Under his watch, Ecuador's homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023 to 38.76 per 100,000 people in 2024. But despite the decrease, the rate remained far higher than the 6.85 homicides per 100,000 people seen in 2019. González’s defeat marks the third consecutive time that the party of Correa, the country’s most influential president this century, failed to return to the presidency. Electoral observers from the Organisation of American States and the European Union monitored the vote, but have not released their reports."

Trump, meanwhile, said on his social media platform that there ultimately will be no exemptions for his sweeping tariff agenda, disputing claims that he has granted exceptions for certain electronics, including smart phones, whose production is concentrated in China. Rather, Trump said, “those products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket'"". Electronics are set to be targeted by tariffs as part of a government probe into semiconductors. White House advisers and Cabinet members tried to project confidence and calm amid Trump’s on-again, off-again approach to tariffs on imported goods from around the world. But their explanations about the overall agenda, coupled with Trump’s latest statements, also reflected shifting narratives. Although Trump had promised an immediate economic boost and lower prices during his 2024 campaign, he is now asking US businesses and consumers for patience. A week ago, Trump’s team stood by his promise to leave the impending tariffs in place without exceptions. They used their latest news show appearances to defend his move to scale back ""reciprocal"" tariffs for most nations except China (145%), while seeming to grant exemptions for certain electronics. These included smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and semiconductor chips. Here are the highlights of what Trump's team said last week vs. Sunday: Long before launching his first presidential campaign in 2015, Trump bemoaned the offshoring of US manufacturing. By imposing steeper levies on other countries, he promised to reindustrialise the United States and eliminate trade deficits with other countries. Last week — however — Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, interviewed on CBS’ “Face the Nation”, played up national security motivations for tariffs. “You’ve got to realise this is a national security issue,” he said, raising the worst-case scenarios of what could happen if the US were involved in a war. “We don’t make medicine in this country anymore. We don’t make ships. We don’t have enough steel and aluminium to fight a battle, right?” he said. On Sunday, Lutnick then stuck to that national security framing, but White House trade adviser Peter Navarro focused more on tariffs offering the US economic leverage. “The world cheats us. They’ve been cheating us for decades,” Navarro said on NBC’s “Meet the Press”. He cited practices such as dumping products at unfairly low prices, currency manipulation and barriers to US car and agricultural products entering foreign markets. Navarro insisted the tariffs would yield broader bilateral trade deals to address all those issues. But he also relied on a separate justification when discussing China: the illicit drug trade. “China has killed over a million people with their fentanyl,” he said. Speaking before Trump’s Truth Social post disputing rumours of exemptions, Lutnick alluded to that coming policy. “They’re going to have a special focus-type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,” he told ABC’s “This Week”. With the higher rates set to be collected from 9 April, administration officials argued that other countries would rush to the negotiating table. “I’ve heard that there are negotiations ongoing and that there are a number of offers,” Kevin Hassett, director of the White House Economic Council, told ABC. He claimed that “more than 50 countries (were) reaching out,” though he did not name any. On Sunday, Navarro named the United Kingdom, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Israel as among the nations in active negotiations with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Lutnick and other officials. Greer said on CBS that his goal was “to get meaningful deals before 90 days” — the duration of Trump’s pause — “and I think we’re going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks”. Talks with China have not begun, he said. “We expect to have a conversation with them,” he said, emphasising it would be between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump took an aggressive tone himself Sunday in a social media post, saying “we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People”. Navarro was not as specific about Beijing. “We have opened up our invitation to them,” he said. Lutnick characterised the outreach as “soft entrees … through intermediaries”. Pressed on whether there is any meaningful back and forth, Navarro said, “The president has a very good relationship with President Xi”. Then he proceeded to criticise several of China’s polices and trade practices. Last week, Navarro was bullish even after US and global trading markets suffered trillions of dollars in losses. “The first rule, particularly for the smaller investors out there, you can’t lose money unless you sell. And, right now, the smart strategy is not to panic,” he said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures”. On Sunday, Navarro’s optimism did not waver despite another net-loss week for securities markets and rocky bond markets. “So, this is unfolding exactly like we thought it would in a dominant scenario,” he said. Others confronted some of the more complex realities of trying to achieve Trump’s goal of restoring a bygone era of US manufacturing. Lutnick suggested the focus is on returning high-tech jobs, while sidestepping questions about lower-skilled manufacturing of goods such as shoes that could mean higher prices because of higher wages for US workers. But some of that high-tech production is what Trump has, for now, exempted from the tariffs that he and his advisers frame as leverage for forcing companies to open US facilities. Hassett did acknowledge widespread angst. “The survey data has been showing that people are anxious about the changes a little bit,” he said, before steering his answer to employment rates. “The hard data,” he said, “has been really, really strong”."

The Iranian court also convicted My Favourite Cake producer Gholamreza Mousavi to the same sentence as the directors, which also includes a fine of 400 million Iranian Rials (€8,240).  My Favourite Cake follows a lonely septuagenarian widow Mahin (Lily Farhadpour) in Tehran who rediscovers her desires in a country where women’s rights are heavily restricted.    “We wanted to tell the story of the reality of our lives, which is about those forbidden things like singing, dancing, not wearing hijab at home, which no one does at home,” Moghaddam previously said.  The New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran commented on the verdict: “Artists in Iran endure significant hardships, including increasing censorship, arbitrary detentions and the constant threat of legal repercussions for expressing dissent through their work.” The 14-month sentence, which has been suspended for five years, comes after the global film community rallied in support of the directors with a petition whose signatories included Pedro Almodóvar, Juliette Binoche and the aforementioned Mohammad Rasoulof.  In our interview with Mohammad Rasoulof, he stated: “I’d like to flag up the filmmakers of My Favourite Cake, Maryam Moghadam and Behtash Sanaeeha, who are undergoing all sorts of problems inside Iran. They are banned from leaving the country because of their films, and in fact, they are being investigated for similar charges for spreading prostitution and corruption on Earth, for instance. This atmosphere will be the cause of a series of new problems because in the world now, it’s not possible to control content, like the Iranian regime does. The result of this is more and more repression, and acts of subversion will surface, as the government cannot control everything.”   You can read the full interview here.    In our review for My Favourite Cake, we wrote: “My Favourite Cake is a gently subversive film that dares to pepper radicalism within a poignant tragicomedy. (...) Behind a seemingly harmless set up and a Linklater-ish second half lies messages of female empowerment that are not tolerated under the nation’s repressive regime. Driven by two magnificent central performances, which make the allegorically loaded epilogue truly resonant, Moghaddam and Sanaeeh’s film is a subtle but powerful snapshot of the harsh realities facing Iranian women, as well as a commentary about what could befall those daring to take control of their destinies. It’s impressive and haunting in equal measure.” "

The Trump administration also announced tariff exemptions for electronic products coming from China over the weekend, although more levies could arrive as part of a state probe into semiconductors. This shift is likely to refocus investors’ attention on economic fundamentals and key events, including the European Central Bank’s (ECB) interest rate decision and China’s quarterly GDP. Additionally, global companies will begin the earnings season, with key results from ASML and Netflix in the spotlight. These earnings reports will offer insights into the broader economic impact of escalating trade tensions and help shape future market sentiment. The ECB is expected to continue cutting key policy rates by 25 basis points amid a worsening growth outlook and mounting risks of inflation stemming from tariffs. The bank lowered interest rates for the second consecutive time in March, bringing the deposit rate down to 2.5%. A further reduction would see the rate fall to 2.25%. The Governing Council appears divided over the rate path. Some members argue that a strong euro and persistent economic uncertainty may prolong deflationary pressures in the eurozone, while others strike a more cautious tone due to fears of tariff-fuelled inflation. Economists forecast that the ECB will implement at least three further cuts after April, bringing the deposit rate to 1.5% by year-end. Nevertheless, the central bank is expected to reaffirm its “data-dependent” and “meeting-by-meeting” approach through its next decision. Germany’s ZEW economic sentiment for April is set to be released this Tuesday, delivering an outlook for Europe’s biggest economy. In March, the index rose to 51.6, the highest since February 2022, due to optimism towards the country's historical debt reform and the EU’s plan to increase spending. However, consensus suggests that economic sentiment will sharply decline to 10.6, or a three-month low, as the US continues its chaotic tariff threats. Additionally, Europe’s biggest chip equipment manufacturer, ASML, is set to report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. The Dutch firm is expected to report earnings per share of $6.12 (€5.4), an 81% year-on-year surge. Its guidance is critical for stock performance as uncertainty over Trump’s tariffs continue to concern investors. The retail sales change for March in America is set to be a key indicator for the country’s consumer sentiment. In February, the data increased 0.2% month on month, rebounding from a downwardly revised 1.2% drop in the previous month. Despite tariff woes, retail sales are expected to grow 1.4% in March. And the core data, excluding automobiles, is forecast to increase 0.4%, up from 0.3% in February. Netflix will be the first major tech company to report its quarterly earnings this week. The streamer remains the most resilient performer among big tech firms, as the industry is not directly impacted by Trump’s tariffs or retaliatory measures from other nations. In recent quarters, Netflix has delivered robust earnings that consistently exceeded analysts’ expectations, supported by its ad-tier programme and crackdown on password sharing. The company is expected to report earnings per share of $5.70 (€6.50) on revenue of $10.5 billion (€12 billion), reflecting year-on-year increases of 8% and 12%, respectively, according to FactSet. China is set to release its first-quarter Gross Domestic Product figures on Wednesday, a key indicator for assessing the country’s economic trajectory. Analysts expect the economy to expand by 5.1% year-on-year in the first three months, marking a slowdown from 5.4% in the previous quarter. Beijing has set a growth target of 5% for 2025. However, economists forecast that the world’s second-largest economy will grow by just 4.5% this year, weighed down by persistently weak consumer demand and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The country will also publish other key economic indicators for March, including industrial production, retail sales, and fixed asset investment. Retail sales are projected to improve, rising 4.2% year on year, up from February’s 4.0% growth. However, industrial output is expected to ease slightly, slowing to 5.7% from 5.9% in the previous month."

The beloved pachyderm gets her “pedicure,” along with apple slices every day. The treatment is part of the zoo’s specialised geriatric care for ageing animals that cannot be reintroduced into the wild as zoos worldwide increasingly emphasise lifelong care. “Sending them back into nature would be an error,"" said Pilar Padilla, head of the zoo's mammal care. ""It is very likely they wouldn’t survive.” Zoos have undergone a rethink in recent decades with the emphasis on the conservation of species and education, moving away from the past paradigm that often displayed exotic animals as a spectacle. The new approach includes knowing how to adapt to the needs of ageing animals, which has led zoos to create bigger, more nature-like enclosures, such as the Sahel-Savannah area at the zoo in the Spanish city of Barcelona. Along with breeding programmes to reintroduce fit animals into nature, zoos today want to ensure that animals living longer due to advancements in veterinary care can age gracefully, said Martín Zordan, the CEO of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, or WAZA. “Specialised geriatric care is becoming increasingly essential,"" Zordan told The Associated Press at the organisation’s Barcelona offices. Zordan said that just like older people, elderly animals require more care: regular health checks, arthritis treatment, softer foods or nutritional supplements, adapted living spaces and monitoring of mental and behavioural health. Along with caring for a pair of ageing elephants, the Barcelona Zoo is also the home for a 15-year-old wolf, a leopard and a tiger who are both 17, as well as some older birds - including a flock of senior flamingos. It's not alone - several zoos in the United States, for example, highlight their treatment of older animals, such as the zoos in Baltimore and Baton Rouge. Zookeepers at the Barcelona Zoo, not far from the city’s Mediterranean coastline, are closely monitoring its two ageing female pachyderms, Susi and Bully (pronounced BUH'-yi), as they cope with the recent death of Yoyo, their former pen-mate and long-time companion. Yoyo died in December at age 54. Susi, at 52, is now among the oldest known African elephants in captivity, even though WAZA said the age of animals born in the wild is approximate. Bully, who is 40, is also considered old for an African elephant. All three were captured in the wild and spent time in circuses and other zoos before coming to Barcelona. The zoo is now working with the University of Barcelona to study the impact of Yoyo's death on Susi and Bully. It’s the first study of its kind, focused on elephants not from the same family after the death of a long-time companion, Padilla told The Associated Press during a recent visit to the zoo’s elephant enclosure. At first, Susi and Bully showed their shock by not eating, but are now adapting well and turning to one another, including even sharing food, Padilla said, adding that Susi has taken on the dominant role that Yoyo had. For elephants, their teeth are the real age test. “What marks the decline of the animal is the wear on their teeth,” Barcelona zookeeper José María Santamaría said after finishing the Bully’s pedicure. “They go through six sets of molars during their life, and when they reach around 40 years old they lose the last set.” Susi and Bully require daily checkups, food suited for their now molar-less mouths and extra attention to their legs - hence the daily pedicures and the enclosure's soft sandy floor to cushion aching feet. “Those are the sort of considerations taken because we care about these animals living comfortably and leading lives with dignity,” Zordan said."

Marsh's friend, director Sir Michael Lindsay-Hogg, said in a statement to the PA news agency that the actress ""died peacefully in bed looked after by one of her very loving carers"".  ""She was as wise and funny as anyone I ever met, as well as being very pretty and kind, and talented as both an actress and writer,” he added. ""An instinctively empathetic person who was loved by everyone who met her. We spoke on the phone almost every day for the past 40 years."" Marsh won an Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a limited series in 1976 for Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 – 1975) – a series which depicted the life of the servants (""downstairs"") and their masters, the family (""upstairs"") between the years 1903 and 1930, showing the slow decline of the British aristocracy during the Edwardian period, the First World War and the Roaring Twenties. Marsh co-created the series with Dame Eileen Atkins, a show which is said to have partly inspired the hugely popular Downton Abbey series. Upstairs, Downstairs was later revived and reimagined in 2010, and Marsh became the only original cast member to return.  Born on 1 July 1934 in Stoke Newington, north London, Marsh took dance and mime classes as therapy for an illness at a young age. She made her West End debut in The Land Of The Christmas Stockings at The Duke of York's Theatre when she was just 12 years old.   Marsh starred in films like Alfred Hitchcock’s Frenzy (1972), the famous British war film The Eagle Has Landed (1976), the Val Kilmer-starring adventure film Willow (1988). She appeared in iconic shows such as The Twilight Zone, Danger Man, Hawaii Five-O and Murder, She Wrote, and is known to many sci-fi fans as Sara Kingdom, a companion of the First Doctor in Doctor Who. She was briefly married to actor Jon Pertwee, the third incarnation of the Doctor. In 2012, she was made an Officer of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama. "

Last Thursday, ministers from more than 30 countries convened at a meeting led by France and the UK to discuss the formation of a reassurance force for Ukraine, intended to oversee the implementation of any future peace deal. Key details—such as the number of troops involved and the deployment timeline—remain uncertain. Questions also persist about Europe's capacity to establish a credible peacekeeping force without US support, given many European countries' limited military resources and fiscal constraints.

Warmer evenings! Chocolate eggs! April is in full swing, and so is 2025's cultural calendar. Cannes Film Festival announced its 2025 line-up last week, with Competition highlights including Julia Ducournau’s Alpha, Ari Aster's Eddington, and Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme. It will also premiere Tom Cruise's highly-anticipated Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (which we're very excited about, despite the dubious trailer dialogue...) In other news: London's National Gallery is inviting one lucky winner to stay the night, a study revealed Europe's music capitals, and this Wes Anderson exhibit at Paris' Cinémathèque Française is the perfect way to prepare for the director's upcoming release. Now for the bit you're really here for: Here are this week's recommendations. David Hockney 25 Where: Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris, France) When: 9 April - 31 August 2025 Nothing says springtime like the colourful cubism of David Hockney, one of the world’s most influential artists. And here’s an opportunity to experience the absolute vastness of his creativity over the decades, with over 400 works being displayed at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. “This exhibition means an enormous amount because it is the largest exhibition I’ve ever had,” the 87-year-old said in a press statement. “Some of the very last paintings I’m working on now will be included in it, and I think it’s going to be very good.” We concur! Shame the Paris metro hasn’t been so enthusiastic…  Morris Mania Where: William Morris Gallery (London, UK) When: Until 21 September 2025 From curtains to wallpaper, bags and shoes, the textile prints of British designer William Morris have become one of — if not the most — recognised and beloved in the world. Inspired by the botanical beauty of flora and fauna, they instantly conjure a sense of timeless, English county romanticism that remains ubiquitous through mass-production. The William Morris Gallery explores this legacy through a vast selection of objects, highlighting the designer's vast yet complicated impact on culture, 125 years after his death. Amazonias  Where: Musée des Confluences (Lyon, France)  When: 18 April 2025 - 8 February 2026 The largest rainforest in the world has long captivated outsiders as a place of ecological wonder and mystery. Spanning eight South American countries, including one overseas territory, it is home to approximately 10 per cent of all known species on earth — and more than 400 different indigenous groups, according to the WWF. Working alongside the representatives of some of these communities, the Musée des Confluences has assembled a collection of more than 500 objects, including photographs and video footage. Of these, 220 are being put on display in a rare and enriching insight into the diverse experiences and living cultures of contemporary Amazonian peoples.  Jazzkaar  Where: Tallinn, Estonia When: 20 April - 1 May 2025 All that jazz — in the Baltics! Since 1990, Jazzkaar has been a cornerstone of Europe’s festival calendar, spotlighting the very best in jazz through a vibrant, versatile programme. While proudly championing Estonian talent, it’s also a hub of international talent and collaborations — this year's edition features over 30 concerts from musicians across 14 countries. Headlining the event is Grammy-nominated American singer-songwriter Jazzmeia Horn; joined by global jazz greats like Arkady Gotesman, Kresten Osgood and the James Carter Organ Trio. Explore the full programme here.  Sinners Where: European cinemas  When: 18 April  In another entry to 2025's trend of actors doing dual roles, Michael B. Jordan plays Smoke and Stack, twin brothers returning to their hometown in search of a new start — only to be confronted with vampires and Ku Klux Klan. Directed by Ryan Coogler (Black Panther, Creed) and set in Jim Crow-era Mississippi, it utilises supernatural horror and historical tension to put a stake through the heart of dark pasts. There's all the markers for a bloody great blockbuster here — and after A Minecraft Movie, phew. Stay tuned to Euronews Culture for our review... Warfare Where: European cinemas When: 18 April The follow up to last year's divisive thriller Civil War, Alex Garland's new film is another visceral and violent portrayal of military horror — this time based on a tragic experience by Iraq War veteran and project collaborator, Ray Mendoza. Led by a star-studded ensemble cast of Kit Connor, Will Poulter, Joseph Quinn and Charles Melton as American Navy SEALs faced with the fallout from an enemy IED (Improvised Explosive Device), it's set to be a brutal depiction of combat that revives twenty-year-old terror with immersive accuracy. Black Mirror Where: Netflix When: Streaming now  For nearly every new depressing plot twist in this thing we call life, there is a Black Mirror episode that warned us first. Now in its seventh series, Charlie Brooker’s dark satire has become a lens through which the world navigates and flexes its anxieties, grappling with societal ills and the relentless advancement of technology through bleak sci-fi set-ups. As always, a star-studded ensemble cast leads this latest batch, including Peter Capaldi, Will Poulter, Awkwafina, Chris O’Dowd, and Rashida Jones. From cold case murders linked to '90s video games to systems that allow people to revisit their photographic memories, Brooker has confirmed: “There’s definitely some disturbing content in it.” With a reality like this, please — disturb us!    Kate Folk - ""Sky Daddy: A Novel"" Desire is always turbulent, but quite literally so for Linda — a young woman who is sexually attracted to planes. Through this strange and somewhat shocking premise, author Kate Folk unravels the complexities of female sexuality; the ways in which people find themselves confined by societal expectations while longing for their true wants to take flight. It also arrives at a time when film, TV and literature are noticeably (and finally!) turning a sharper focus to women's turn-ons, be it Babygirl, Dying for Sex or Rebecca Yarros' bestselling romantasy ""Empyrean"" series. Through the symbolism of a giant flying object, carrying both hope and fear, Folk reminds us that journeys of self-exploration often require soaring beyond unconventionality and embracing a destination unknown. Julien Baker & Torres: Send a Prayer My Way When: 18 April Boygenius bandmate Julien Baker teams up with Mackenzie Ruth Scott of Torres for a debut album that reclaims country music, reconnecting with southern American identity through confessionals about friendship and queerness. Inspired by outlaw country and the singers that soundtracked Scott's childhood, singles like 'Tuesday' tenderly twang with nostalgia — and promise an album that'll carry us towards honky-tonk bars and some good old fashioned heart healin'."
3e8f3b07-3363-4def-9d7a-def2b42cdc70,https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/14/is-spain-banning-the-use-of-50-notes,04.14.2025 05:45 GMT+1,Is Spain banning the use of €50 notes?,"The internet has erupted with claims that Spain is doing away with the €50 banknote after news reports came out alleging that it's on its way out. This article says that the banknote's days are numbered as it'll be withdrawn in April, and that there's no turning back. It has since been taken offline but not before it sparked panic that the move would have a damaging effect on the pockets of thousands of citizens. However, the claims aren't true: Spain's central bank has confirmed that it hasn't ordered the withdrawal of any banknote, that all notes can keep being used as normal and that none of them will lose their value.  It explained where the confusion may have come from: as part of its daily activities, the central bank routinely checks the authenticity and quality of notes returning from credit institutions. Notes and coins deemed not to be in a suitable state are withdrawn, destroyed and replaced by new ones, while those in good condition are put back into circulation. The Bank of Spain said that it does this for all denominations, not just €50, and stressed that even if a banknote is damaged, it doesn't lose its value and can be exchanged for a new one. ""One reason for trying to keep banknotes in good shape is to make it easier to check their security features,"" the bank said. ""Although banknotes are made to last, they usually show signs of wear and tear over time from regular use.""  EuroVerify approached the Bank of Spain for further comment, but it referred us back to its press release. Indeed, other news reports have been published making this slight distinction: they say that only some €50 notes will be withdrawn from circulation, rather than a blanket ban, and explain how old and worn notes can be exchanged. Similar false claims have been doing the rounds in Italy too, specifically alleging that the European Central Bank (ECB) is banning €50 banknotes in April, as part of a strategy to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. However, Italian fact-checkers have already debunked these rumours, stating that neither the ECB nor the Bank of Italy have made any such decision. The ECB told EuroVerify: ""Neither Banco de España nor any other central bank within the euro area has ordered the withdrawal of any euro banknote or coin. All euro banknotes retain their value and remain in circulation."" The rumours of banknotes being withdrawn feed into an overarching disinformation narrative that European countries are trying to phase out cash and replace it with a digital euro. Some allege that doing so will hand control over citizens' money to the authorities, allowing them to block transactions and have a greater say over people's spending. However, the ECB and other central banks in Europe have repeatedly assured that any digital currency would complement cash, not replace it. Experts told EuroVerify that it's perfectly normal for financial institutions to withdraw and destroy old, damaged notes to guard against criminal activity. ""Regular updates of banknotes and their security features are common practice of every central bank,"" said Rainer Böhme, professor for security and privacy at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. ""The practice in the Eurosystem is that older banknotes remain valid payment instruments. There is no need to replace cash under the mattress."" ""To my knowledge, every commercial bank does this before restocking ATMs,"" he added. ""Which denominations are replaced with priority depends on observed trends in counterfeiting."" The reason that €50 banknotes tend to be more prone to tampering is that they are easier for criminals to handle in bulk, according to Michael Levi, professor of criminology at the University of Cardiff in Wales, the UK. ""Obviously the larger the denomination, the easier they are for criminals to store because they require less space and weight for value, though they would have to exchange lower denomination notes for €50 ones, as not many drug purchasers are likely to have them,"" he said. ""Notes higher than €50 in some jurisdictions may look suspicious and hard to exchange,"" he continued. ""Perhaps damaged €50 notes may be harder for people to tell if they are genuine or not, and harder for automatic machines to analyse – or it may be that they are more likely to be damaged via lifestyles of street criminals."""

He was 89. He was a prolific author and essayist, penning celebrated novels including The Time of the Hero (""La Ciudad y los Perros"") and Feast of the Goat. Vargas Llosa won myriad prizes, including the 2010 Nobel Prize for Literature. “It is with deep sorrow that we announce that our father, Mario Vargas Llosa, passed away peacefully in Lima today, surrounded by his family,” read a letter signed by his children Álvaro, Gonzalo and Morgana, and posted by Álvaro on X. “His departure will sadden his relatives, his friends and his readers around the world, but we hope that they will find comfort, as we do, in the fact that he enjoyed a long, adventurous and fruitful life, and leaves behind him a body of work that will outlive him,” they added. Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa was born on 28 March 1936, in Peru’s southern city of Arequipa, high in the Andes at the foot of the Misti volcano. His father, Ernesto Vargas Maldonado, left the family before he was born. To avoid public scandal, his mother, Dora Llosa Ureta, took her child to Bolivia, where her father was the Peruvian consul in Cochabamba. Vargas Llosa said his early life was “somewhat traumatic"". He was pampered by his mother and grandmother in a large house with servants, and his every whim was granted. Vargas Llosa started writing early, and at 15 was a part-time crime reporter for La Crónica newspaper. According to his official website, other jobs he had included revising names on cemetery tombs in Peru, working as a teacher in the Berlitz school in Paris and briefly on the Spanish desk at Agence France-Presse in Paris. He published his first short story collection, The Cubs and Other Stories (""Los Jefes"") in 1959. However, he only burst onto the literary stage in 1963 with his groundbreaking debut The Time of the Hero, a novel that drew on his experiences at a Peruvian military academy and angered the country’s military. A thousand copies were burned by military authorities, with some generals calling the book false and Vargas Llosa a communist. That, and subsequent novels such as Conversation in the Cathedral, (""Conversación en la Catedral"") in 1969, quickly established Vargas Llosa as one of the leaders of the so-called “Boom,” or new wave of Latin American writers of the 1960s and 1970s, alongside Gabriel García Márquez and Carlos Fuentes. He continued publishing articles in the press for most of his life, notably in a twice-monthly political opinion column titled “Piedra de Toque” (Touchstones) printed in several newspapers. Vargas Llosa came to be a fierce defender of personal and economic liberties, gradually edging away from his communism-linked past, and regularly attacked Latin American leftist leaders he viewed as dictators. Although an early supporter of the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro, he later grew disillusioned and denounced Castro’s Cuba. By 1980, he said he no longer believed in socialism as a solution for developing nations. In a famous incident in Mexico City in 1976, Vargas Llosa punched fellow Nobel Prize winner and ex-friend García Márquez, whom he later ridiculed as “Castro’s courtesan”. It was unclear whether the fight was over politics or a personal dispute, as neither writer wanted to discuss it publicly. As he slowly turned his political trajectory toward free-market conservatism, Vargas Llosa lost the support of many of his Latin American literary contemporaries and attracted much criticism even from admirers of his work. In 1990, he ran for the presidency of Peru, but lost out to a then-unknown Alberto Fujimori. Vargas Llosa drew much of his inspiration from his Peruvian homeland, but preferred to live abroad, residing for spells each year in Madrid, New York and Paris. His early novels revealed a Peruvian world of military arrogance and brutality, aristocratic decadence, and Stone Age Amazon indigenous people living simultaneously with 20th-century urban blight. “Peru is a kind of incurable illness and my relationship to it is intense, harsh and full of the violence of passion,” Vargas Llosa wrote in 1983. In 1965, he married his first cousin, Patricia Llosa, 10 years his junior, and together they had three children. They divorced five decades later, and he started a relationship with Spanish society figure Isabel Preysler, former wife of singer Julio Iglesias and mother of singer Enrique Iglesias. They separated in 2022. Vargas Llosa is survived by his children."

However, US President Donald Trump and his administration suggested the exemption may be short-lived, stating that tariffs would resume following “National Security Tariff Investigations”, adding further uncertainty to an already volatile trade environment. Trump took to Truth Social on Sunday, insisting that no tariff exemptions had been made, despite the US Customs and Border Protection announcing on Friday that electronic devices – including smartphones, computers, and other components – were exempt from the tariffs: 145% on imports from China and 10% on those from other countries. The White House confirmed the exemptions on Saturday. China’s Ministry of Commerce responded to the US decision on electronics, calling the move as “a small step” in correcting the US’s wrongful imposition of unilateral reciprocal tariffs. The spokesperson stated: “We urge the US side to heed the rational voices of the international community and various domestic sectors, to take a major step toward correcting its mistakes, to completely abandon the erroneous practice of ‘reciprocal tariffs’, and to return to the right path of mutual respect and resolving differences through equal dialogue.” “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, especially not China, which, by far, treats us the worst!” Trump posted in Truth Social later on Sunday, “There was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday,” he added, while noting that the administration was “taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN” as part of the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. He also confirmed that electronics would be subject to the 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, stating, “They are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’ The Fake News knows this but refuses to report it.” US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick also confirmed during an interview with ABC News earlier on Sunday that the exemptions “are not permanent” and that new tariffs “are coming in probably a month or two.” European markets are set to open higher, even as Trump hinted at a tariff reversal in the near future. As of 5:00 am CEST, stock futures were broadly positive, with the Euro Stoxx 50 rising 2.5%, Germany’s DAX up 2.28%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 gaining 2.01%. The euro also surged against the US dollar, as the dollar extended weakness amid heightened economic uncertainty. The EUR/USD pair climbed above 1.04 before retreating slightly during the early Asian session. In the US, stock futures rose in early Monday trade following the weekend’s policy developments. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.3%, the S&P 500 gained 0.85%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.24% as of 5:05 am CEST. Technology stocks in the US are expected to be in focus, as the sector was among the hardest hit by Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. Apple, in particular, was one of the worst performers before the recent market rebound, tumbling 22% before last Wednesday’s historic rally when Trump announced the 90-day tariff pause. With much of its manufacturing based in China, Apple is especially vulnerable to import levies, and analysts had warned of significant pressure on the company’s profit margins. The electronics exemption may thus provide a catalyst for a short-term rebound in Apple shares. Asian markets also gained, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index leading the charge. The index climbed 2.42% as of 5:20 am CEST after China reported a 12% year-on-year increase in exports last month. However, analysts believe the surge may reflect front-loading by exporters attempting to beat the deadline for new tariffs, raising concerns of a potential slowdown in the coming months. Other major regional indices also advanced. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.85%, Australia’s ASX 200 climbed 1.52%, and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.76% in the same time frame."

It said exports from the world's second largest economy rose 5.8% in the first three months of the year from a year earlier while imports sank 7%. China’s trade surplus with the United States was $27.6 billion (€24.77bn) in March as its exports rose 4.5%. It logged a surplus of $76.6 billion with the US in the first quarter of the year. China is facing 145% tariffs on most exports to the United States as of the most recent revisions in Trump’s trade policies. However, the biggest increases in exports were to China's Southeast Asian neighbours, which saw exports from China jump nearly 17% in March from a year earlier. Exports to Africa rose more than 11%. Chinese President Xi Jinping was traveling to Vietnam on Monday as part of a regional tour that also will take him to Malaysia and Cambodia, giving him an opportunity to firm up trade ties with other Asian countries that also are facing potentially steep tariffs, though last week Trump delayed enforcing them by 90 days. China's exports to Vietnam jumped nearly 17% last month from a year earlier, while its imports fell 2.7%. While Xi’s trip likely was planned earlier, it gained significance amid the trade war between Washington and Beijing. A customs administration spokesperson, Lyu Daliang, said China was facing a “complex and severe external situation” but that the sky would not fall. He pointed to China’s diversified export options and huge domestic market. When asked about falling Chinese imports, he told reporters that China has been the world’s second largest importer for 16 straight years, increasing its share of global imports from about 8% to 10.5%. “At present and in the future, China’s import growth space is huge, and the large Chinese market is always a great opportunity for the world,” he said."

Germany, the UK, France and Italy have the most investors. However, for 56% of 18-34 year olds, a lack of knowledge or understanding was the top barrier to investing, followed by a lack of money, cited by 52% of respondents. Fear of losing money and a lack of time were other major reasons for not investing.  Carl Hazeley, the newly-appointed CEO of Finimize, a financial insights, news and research platform, addressed the idea that a lack of capital is a barrier to investing.  “It was true 10-15 years ago that you needed a certain amount of money to think about investing. And that's just not the case anymore,” he said.  He highlighted that Finimize hoped to “increase the net worth of an entire generation” by providing the tools for users to “become their own financial advisor”. In this episode of The Big Question, Carl Hazeley joins Hannah Brown to discuss the importance of investing, especially for younger people, while shedding more light on current investment trends.  Research suggests that a significant generational wealth transfer, worth about €73 trillion, is poised to happen in the next two decades in the US, with Gen Xers and millennials mainly receiving the money via inheritance.  This potential wealth redistribution has made it more crucial for younger investors to learn how to invest and compound their funds.  Current global economic conditions, such as high inflation, also risk eroding bank funds.  “If inflation is at 2% for 30 years: €1,000, it’s worth €500. If inflation is at 10% for seven years, that €1,000 goes to €500,” Hazeley said. “Investing broadly helps shield you from that impact, it’ll grow your money, at least in line with inflation, hopefully more. And that means, when you get to later stages in life, you have a nest egg to retire with.” Longer life spans and more sophisticated healthcare are making retirement more expensive too.  “There's a generation of people, millennials and downwards, who are sleepwalking toward a retirement where with rising life expectancies, improved medications, we’re all going to live much longer and have no money to fund that retirement,” Hazeley explained.  “That’s why it’s never been more important to take advantage of education and for modern retail investors to invest.” Newsletters, websites and podcasts can all help with investing knowledge, with just 5 to 10 minutes a day, according to Hazeley, who likened it to “learning a language”. “You'll find eventually that you can join the dots between an event and a response,” he added. However, it is vital to be cautious while investing, warned Hazeley: “If someone’s guaranteeing a return, they’re either lying to you or breaking the law. No real investor can guarantee anything.” The rise of smartphones and online investing content has made investing more accessible than ever before, according to Hazeley.  Although Finimize has played a role in improving accessibility to investing content, there’s still a long way to go.  “I can’t confidently say that it’s as accessible as it needs to be for everyone. I think that’s a moving target, and it’s a goal that the industry should aspire to. If it was accessible, I think we’d be having a very different type of conversation, even on the same topic,” Hazeley said.  For those younger people who do invest, they are becoming much more conscious about the way they invest.  Around 42% of modern retail investors shared that they wouldn’t invest in something if it didn’t align with their values, even if it was profitable, according to Finimize’s Q2 2024 Modern Investor Pulse.  Similarly, 48% of respondents revealed that investing ethically was important to them, with thematic investing, both trend-focused and climate-focused, being especially important to millennials.

The missiles struck on Sunday as Christian faithful gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday – the Sunday before Easter, in which Jesus Christ is believed to have entered Jerusalem. The attacks were carried out in the morning, with officials saying the first of the missiles struck around 10:15 am local time (9:15 am CEST). Images from the site showed lines of black body bags on the roadside, while more bodies were seen wrapped in foil blankets among the debris. Video footage also showed fire crews fighting to extinguish burning cars among the rubble from damaged buildings. The dead included two children, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in a statement. A further 15 children were also injured, to varying degrees. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said among those children was a toddler – a newborn girl born in 2025 – as he detailed the horrific attack. “The first one struck a building - one of the university buildings. The second one exploded virtually over the street. 117 people were injured, including children, among them a girl born in 2025,"" said Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian leader slammed Russia for what he called a heinous attack targeting civilians. ""The strike hit the city centre on Palm Sunday. Only filthy scum can act like this."" Zelenskyy says the attack comes just a few days after the one-month mark of Russia’s refusal of a US-proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire, agreed by Ukraine on 11 March. He’s routinely accused Moscow of stalling in search of more concessions, questioning their seriousness about peace. “They are not afraid. And that’s precisely why (they resort to) ballistic missiles. That’s why every night there are around a hundred strike drones, most of them Shaheds (strike drones) which target ordinary Ukrainian cities,” added Zelenskyy. He also called for a global response to the attack, saying ""only pressure, only decisive action' would stop attacks like Sunday's strike from undermining efforts to bring an end to the war. The attack on Sumy followed a deadly 4 April missile strike on Zelenskyy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih that killed some 20 people, including nine children. It also came a day after Russia and Ukraine’s diplomats accused each other of violating a tentative US-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges of negotiating an end to Moscow's more than three-year war."

Péter Magyar, the leader of the Respect and Freedom or Tisza party, has become the most serious challenger to Orbán's power since the right-wing leader took office in 2010. Recent polling suggests that Tisza has overtaken Orbán's Fidesz party as Hungary struggles with a stagnating economy and has been politically sidelined in the European Union over Orbán's policies. Speaking at a rally in Budapest on Sunday, Magyar said that, if elected, he would restore Hungary's relationships and reputation among its allies that have suffered as Orbán has attacked the EU and pursued close relationships with autocracies like Russia and China. “We will finally put our common affairs in order,” Magyar said. ""Our homeland, Hungary, will once again be a proud and reliable ally of NATO. Hungary will once again be a full-fledged member of the European Union,” Magyar emphasised. Orbán, a self-described “illiberal” leader, has been accused by critics of leading Hungary out of the community of European democracies by eroding democratic institutions, violating judicial independence and taking over much of Hungary's media. Since taking power in 2010, he and his Fidesz party have led the country with a two-thirds majority in parliament, and easily defeated any opposition. But recent polls suggest that Tisza has pulled ahead of Fidesz in popularity as Magyar's campaign focuses on economic and social issues facing the country like persistent inflation, a poor healthcare system and alleged government corruption. At the rally, Nóra Farkas, a supporter of Magyar, said she had hoped for Orbán's defeat in Hungary's last national elections in 2022. However, with around a year before the next ballot, she is more confident that change is possible. “Anyone who thinks things are going well in this country is blind. Orbán and his circle are the main reason for the problems,"" she said. Magyar said Orbán's system “cannot be reformed, cannot be fixed, cannot be improved. This system can only be replaced, and that is what we will do — lawfully, democratically, but with determination, we will cut down the regime.”"

The Osaka Expo will be held at Yumeshima, which means ""Dream Island"", a reclaimed industrial waste burial site in the Osaka Bay. Participants from more than 160 countries, regions and organisations showcase their futuristic exhibits inside about 80 pavilions of unique architecture. The main theme of the second Osaka Expo is to “create a future society for our lives.” The city held the Expo once before in 1970, which set record numbers for the event, attracting 64 million visitors. The record was only beaten decades later in 2010 in Shanghai. Organisers expect about 28 million visitors to trickle through by mid-October. However, ticket sales have been slow, with the event having only sold about nine million tickets in advance, short of the initial target of 14 million. “It’s been 55 years since the last Expo in Osaka. I've been looking forward to it,” said Daiki Chiba, who travelled from Sendai, about 900 kilometres northeast of Osaka. Many visitors carried Myaku-Myaku mascots, the official symbol and logo of the event, or wore clothes matching its colours — red, blue and white — to get in the mood. The mascot is an imaginary creature featuring a blue face encircled by red balls, some eyeballs. Organisers say it was born from the fusion of cells and water in a small spring in the Kansai region. The Expo comes only four years after Japan struggled to host the no-audience Tokyo Olympics during the coronavirus pandemic. It opens in the wake of trade wars and fears of a global economic downturn sparked by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, the three-year Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Middle East conflicts. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba compared the global tensions to a “national crisis” and said that Trump's tariffs, especially the 25% duty on automobiles, would be a blow to all industries and Japan's economy. But, Japan is still committed despite all the global uncertainty to turn it into an opportunity. “I think the timing is actually quite fitting,” said Sachiko Yoshimura, head of Expo 2025 global communications. “Holding the Expo now could eventually help to address the divisions in the world. ... I believe this Expo in Japan might actually lead to stronger international relationships and improvements,” he added. Exhibits of cutting-edge technology, such as robots and flying cars, as well as pop culture like Hello Kitty and Gundam, are among the highlights of the Expo. The US pavilion focuses on space travel. Its lunar stone from the Apollo 12 mission, a sensation at the 1970 expo, was back on display. China, also highlighting space technology, exhibits soil samples from its lunar missions. Carrying a “Not for sale” sign and decorated with its blue-and-yellow national flags, Ukraine attracted many visitors with a globe and other items carrying barcodes. By scanning them, visitors can see videos showing people's lives at war and their reconstruction effort. Dmytro Liuyi, Ukrainian creative director, said his country's participation was undecided until December due to the ongoing full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv’s pavilion aims to highlight the hardships of war and promote global peace and stability over conflict and misery."

In an interview with ABC News, he emphasised that it would not be ""like a permanent sort of exemption,"" adding that that tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals ""are coming in the next month or two."" ""We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels, we need to have these things made in America. We can't be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us,"" said Lutnick. The Trump administration said late on Friday that it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren’t usually made in the US. The exemptions would benefit American tech giants like Apple, which has 90% of its iPhone production and assembly based in China, according to Wedbush Securities. A notice shared by US Customs and Border Protection said the exemption also applies to the 145% tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, and includes other electronic devices and components, including semiconductors, solar cells and memory cards. It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Saturday, Trump said he'll comment further on the exemptions on Monday. ""We’ll be very specific on Monday. But we're taking in a lot of money as a country. We're taking in a lot of money."""

Navy Captain Sean Barbabella, who conducted Trump’s medical exam on Friday, cited what he described as the US President’s “active lifestyle” and said it “continues to contribute significantly” to his overall well-being.  In the report, Barbabella wrote that Trump is “fully fit to execute the duties of Commander-in-Chief and Head of State,” and highlighted the former president’s “excellent” cognitive health.  The report confirmed Trump scored a perfect 30 out of 30 after the US President claimed he “got every answer right” following the exam.  According to the report, Trump dropped 20 pounds since his last physical as president in 2020. He weighed 244 pounds (110kg) then and is now down to 224 pounds (101kg).  The US president is an avid golfer and said he recently won tournaments played at clubs he owns in Florida.  Trump, who turns 79 in June, was the oldest person to be inaugurated as president when he took office earlier this year. "

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote that ""Russian cruelty struck again,"" calling the attack ""barbaric"" in a post on X. More than 30 people were killed in the missile strike as people gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday, according to officials. Images from the scene showed lines of black body bags lying on the side of the road, while more bodies were seen wrapped in foil blankets among the debris. Video footage also showed fire crews as they fought to extinguish the shells of burned-out cars among the rubble from damaged buildings. A further 99 people were injured, including 11 children, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service. Von der Leyen added that ""Russia was and remains the aggressor, in blatant violation of international law."" The attack on Sumy is the second large-scale attack to claim such a high number of civilian lives in just over a week. A deadly missile strike on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih on 4 April killed some 20 people, including nine children. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said that the Sumy attack crossed “any line of decency” and that the White House remained committed to ending the conflict. “There are scores of civilian dead and wounded. As a former military leader, I understand targeting and this is wrong. It is why President Trump is working hard to end this war,"" he said. Zelenskyy also called for a global response to the attack. “Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and aerial bombs. What’s needed is an attitude toward Russia that a terrorist deserves,” he said. EU Foreign Chief Kaja Kallas also condemned the attack on social media, writing of a ""horrific example of Russia intensifying attacks while Ukraine has accepted an unconditional ceasefire."" French President Emmanuel Macron said that the strike undermined Washington-led peace talks between the two sides. “Everyone knows: This war was initiated by Russia alone. And today, it is clear that Russia alone chooses to continue it — with blatant disregard for human lives, international law and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump,” he wrote in a statement. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ""appalled at Russia's horrific attacks on civilians."" The strikes come a day after Russia and Ukraine’s senior diplomats accused each other of violating a tentative US-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges of negotiating an end to the three-year war. Russian forces hold the advantage in Ukraine, and Kyiv has warned Moscow is planning a fresh spring offensive to ramp up pressure on its foe and improve its negotiating position. Ukraine has endorsed a broader US ceasefire proposal, but Russia has effectively blocked it by imposing far-reaching conditions. European governments have accused Putin of dragging his feet."

Starlink now has thousands of satellites in orbit, providing internet to over 100 countries.   While SpaceX says it’s helping connect remote areas, some worry about the growing number of satellites in space and their impact on the environment.  Critics raise concerns about space debris, atmospheric pollution and the risk of collision in low Earth orbit as satellite numbers grow. "

Spanish authorities claim the organisation contacted Moroccan nationals wanting to migrate to Spain and flew them into Romania. Once in Romania, they travelled by land to Spain through other EU countries inside trucks or vans. The Spanish Civil Guard law enforcement agency said in a statement that the organisation made more than 50 trips to Spain during a two-year period, with groups between 20 and 50 migrants, who paid €3,000 per person. Four people were detained in the city of Cartagena in the Murcia region during a raid which took place sometime during the past days, accused of belonging to a criminal organisation and human trafficking. The logistics centre of the organisation was allegedly set in Romania, where the leader of the gang functioned as a link between the members in Spain, Morocco and Romania, establishing prices to pay by migrants as well as travel logistics. In order to mislead the police, the detainees used shuttle vehicles and smuggled the migrants through border crossings under poor surveillance. The operation was carried out in coordination with Europol and Frontex European Border and Coast Guard Agency."

Amid applause and prayers, the pontiff greeted and blessed the faithful. After completing the tour of the square, the pope went back to his rooms in Santa Marta. ""When we see the multitude of men and women who hate and violence throw on the way to Calvary, let us remember that God transforms this way into a place of redemption, because he walked it by giving his life for us,"" the Pope wrote in his homily for the Palm Sunday Mass read by Cardinal Leonardo Sandri in a square packed with the faithful. ""In the face of the atrocious injustice of evil, carrying the cross of Christ is never in vain, indeed, it is the most concrete way of sharing his saving love,"" the pontiff added in his address. ""The passion of Jesus becomes compassion when we reach out our hand to those who can no longer bear it, when we lift up those who have fallen, when we embrace those who are discouraged,"" he explained. Pope Francis is still recovering from illness after spending 38 days at the Gemelli polyclinic in Rome for double pneumonia, which at times became critical, according to his doctors. After his release from hospital, he continued with his duties as the head of the Catholic Church and the Vatican — although without leading public religious ceremonies — and has appeared publicly several times in the past week. On Thursday, he made a surprise visit to St Peter's Cathedral, while on Saturday he visited the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. On Wednesday, he met the British royals, King Charles III and Queen Camilla, in an unscheduled appearance. Last Sunday, he returned to St Peter's Square for the first time to greet the faithful at the Mass for the Jubilee — the Catholic Church's holy year."

In the middle of a lush, green olive farm in southern Spain looms what appears to be a giant red cube.  LA Almazara is an olive oil mill designed by Philippe Starck on the outskirts of Ronda, a city in Andalusia famous for its dramatic cliffside setting. Step a bit closer and you soon find it is much more than a functional mill; true to the Starck style, this is a work of art. Every inch is symbolic. Start with the giant horn sticking out of one side, which pays homage to the bullfighting tradition in this part of Spain. On another walled side emerges a half-circle. This represents the olives, the lifeblood of this mill. A huge Phoenician eye peers out from a third wall looking out across the 26-hectare estate which produces 60,000 litres of olive oil every year. Step inside and instead of a well-lit showcase, all is gloom. This is meant to encourage visitors to pay close attention to everything inside. So, we have a tiny bull - once again there is that homage to southern Spanish culture - even though Starck is a staunch defender of animal rights. Visitors can also enjoy what's billed as the world’s only museum dedicated to olive oil. Did you know, for instance, that the classic Citroen DS car was oiled with the ‘green gold’ instead of traditional oil? Or that the British imported olive oil when they made the doomed liner Titanic in 1912? It was to cater to the refined tastes of its passengers on its fateful first voyage. As we amble around, a group of visitors arrive to marvel at the architecture and also absorb the history of olive oil. Perhaps s urprisingly, given its importance in cooking in much of the world, it only makes up 1.28% of all edible oil production. Palm oil makes up 32.28%, followed by soya oil (22.37%) and canola oil (11.14%). The sheer scale of the place is striking. This is designed to symbolise the vastness of Andalusia, Spain’s biggest region. Inside the main building, is another huge horn and a vast sword to symbolise the estoque – the weapon used by a matador to dispatch bulls. On one wall hangs a huge portrait of Abbas Ibn Firnas, a 9th century inventor who lived in Ronda when the Moors ruled much of the country. He was credited with coming up with a flying craft way before Leonardo di Vinci. A model of his creation hangs next to his portrait which is perfectly lit so you can see his face. A huge metal tube runs from the portrait of the inventor to a lower level where it symbolically empties the olives into an enormous funnel which feeds the real mill below ground. There is a bar which gives out onto a terrace for meals. It is held up by enormous chains. From the terrace, you can see out into the lush green fields which house the olive trees. It's easy to see why LA Almazara is popular with filmmakers. Robin Wright, of House of Cards fame, came to film from the terrace. Below LA Almazara is a state-of-the-art olive oil mill where visitors can see how the oil is made for themselves. A series of machines crush out the stones, purify the oil and finally leave it to be bottled. Unlike wine, which has to stay in barrels for years at a time, olive oil is ready to use once this refining process is over. Above LA Almazara, is the Greenhouse, where parties of visitors can enjoy a tasting of the oil. It is an unusual process in which you take the oil in the front of your mouth, swill it around and finally swallow.  But before you even put it to your lips, then you should smell the liquid. Stronger oils have a stronger aroma when placed in a glass next to your chest. If any leave an aftertaste, they are not so smooth.   For those who really want to enjoy the experience, there is a Cortijo -  a country house – which is a short walk from LA Almazara. This luxurious five-bedroom country house comes with Starck designed bathtubs and chairs once again in the style of bulls’ horns. A fireplace, surrounded by kindlers, gives the place a snug feel as does the idiosyncratic library. There are books on subjects as varied as the history of bullfighting and classics of Spanish literature. Naturally, it does not come cheap: rooms are about €2,500 per night but you can look out on the lush, green olives around. There is one huge television set but this is really for weekend parties. LA Almazara plans to open a hotel at some time in the future. Like wine tourism in the past, in an age when more people are giving up drinking alcohol, olive oil tasting is popular. I bumped into a middle-aged group of women from Britain who said that fitness was the motive for trying this trip. Euronews Culture: What was your inspiration for LA Almazara?  Philippe Starck: LA Almazara in Ronda is a very special place that took more than 15 years to get off the ground. The background story however is simple, and reflects who I am and how I work. LA Almazara is all about poetic functionalism, using surrealist language as a universal vehicle of communication.  Surrealism because of Andalusia and the village of Ronda itself. Andalusia is a desert with a very strong vibe, home to one of the most beautiful villages in the world. Ronda is one of them. I love this charming little place. I can't look at it without imagining that one day, God was in a bad mood; then suddenly annoyed, God took a sword and cut the village in two, turning Ronda into a normal village with an extra-ordinary cliff in the center.  Functionalism has been another key, from the origin of the project. Over the last 50 years, I have been promoting organic food, starting with OAO, the first modern organic food company I created in 1996. A few years later, in 2003, with my late dear friend Perico (Pedro Gomez de Baeza), we collaborated to create a unique Andalusian-born organic olive oil called LA Organic. It has won many awards since, including “Best Organic EVOO in the World”. It is still produced in Ronda, and now in LA Almazara. When you have the honour to feed people, you have a duty to make sure that it is as honest and healthy as possible. That is why I have always been very proud to produce olive oil.  Especially since it is such a delicate process. From the moment the olives are harvested, to when they reach the mill, time must be minimum. Once the olives are pressed, the oil must be stored in a cool and dark place. Temperature must be stabilized. With all these parameters in mind, I created this wonderfully efficient machine that is LA Almazara. Harvested olives come inside the building through a big tube. Within a few seconds, they are gathered in the central tank, and the milling process can start. All is done with the utmost efficiency and precision, in less than a minute.  Supposedly you are in favour of animal rights, so why the bull’s horn and an estoque which is the sword used to kill the bull? LA Almazara is a place made of symbols reflecting the passion and culture of Andalusia and its inhabitants.  The building is a red monolithic cube, as if fallen from space. With a giant bull’s horn on one façade and an enormous smoking eye on another. It is like an Andalusian Pandora’s box. And I like this mystery of not knowing what you’ll find inside. All dreams become possible. Bullfighting is represented in LA Almazara. What is your view on this?   I am absolutely against bullfighting, as it is an unfair struggle between animal and human, and the animal never wins. Nonetheless, the people of Andalusia live for it, and one cannot deny that it does exist. Can you explain more about the symbolism of LA Almazara?  As well as the symbols on the façade, when you step inside the building, the contrasts are striking. The building is dark and cool, to respect and preserve the delicate olive oil production process.  You have the impression of entering a cathedral, a crypt. Inside, the shadows contain strong symbols, such as a monumental half-olive set into the steel wall in which I had originally planned to put a permanent flame inside, like a kind of holy spirit; a metal pipe that enters the building without ever leaving. The water flows. A monumental chimney welcomes the fire. There is a huge, headless figure - we don't know who it is. This is simply to teach you to think, to speak the language of surrealism.  An aeroplane made of odds and ends, one of the first in history to fly, hangs above the monumental hall. A giant bullfighting sword and an equally disproportionate portrait of its inventor, a matador from Ronda (Abbas Ibn Firnas, a 9th century inventor from Ronda), tower above us. Mr Starck, how would you describe yourself? As I was diagnosed neurodivergent, I am on what is called the spectrum. I cannot live in this world as it exists for most people, thus I live in the ethers, I live elsewhere.  LA Almazara is perhaps the project that most reflects this elsewhere of mine. This is how my life is. Everything is out of the ordinary, out-of-scale, radical, surreal. LA Almazara is a door I have opened on what a human brain can look like.  What was the reaction to LA Almazara?  LA Almazara is a service to the community, to humanity, that honours and protects olive oil. When you discover it, it is like a big ‘slap in the face’, that wakes you up and moves you. When I work on a project, I want people to come away more inspired, more creative. I have seen people come in and start crying, bursting with emotion. I think these reactions show that I have succeeded in that mission. In 1996, you established the Good Goods catalogue with La Redoute, proposing 170 sustainable life objects “for the future moral market”. What inspired the idea? Good Goods, that I created with La Redoute, was a mail-order catalogue of ‘non-products for non-consumers of the future moral market’, including only responsible, ecological, honest and minimal products. Nowadays people are more aware of and committed to the ecological emergency. But back then, Good Goods was one of a kind, perhaps a little too early for this time. I am proud of that; proud of having worked hard to help and serve my community, so that together we look a little higher and a little further. What would you like your legacy to be?  I work day and night to try to understand everything I can, what the future will be like, what will be good and what will be bad. I try to be a light in the fog, a pilot. Because I am living a little out of this world, I have a vision of what can happen and I want to raise awareness, make people react. In my small and humble way, I propose solutions and alternatives, like when I started fighting for democratic design and democratic architecture. We must manage to put a roof over everyone's head, and this will happen only if we reinvent traditional architectural construction, industrializing the development and production in the same way that cars are built. My slogan today is: ‘’a house for the price of a car’’."

At least one patient died during the evacuation as staff couldn’t provide urgent care.  The incident left the hospital unable to provide health care to Palestinians amid catastrophic conditions in Gaza.    Israel said it struck a Hamas command centre in the hospital. It also claimed that prior to the strike, steps were taken to mitigate harm. The attack comes against the backdrop of a near-complete collapse of the health system in Gaza. The Strip faces a severe shortage of medicine and medical equipment as a result of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. Hours after the attack on the hospital, a separate strike in Deir al-Balah killed at least seven people, according to a local morgue.  These strikes came hours after the Israeli defence minister said military activity would rapidly expand across Gaza and that people would need to evacuate from “fighting zones.”  Israel also announced Saturday the completion of the Morag corridor, cutting off the southern city of Rafah from the rest of Gaza, with the military saying it would soon expand “vigorously” in most of the small coastal territory. The war in Gaza started after Hamas fighters carried out an attack on southern Israel on 7 October, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians.  251 hostages were taken, most of whom have since been released as part of negotiations between the two parties. 59 hostages remain, 24 of which are believed to still be alive.  Reciprocal accusations and calls for investigation Hamas described the Israeli targeting of the hospital as a ""new war crime"" and said it was part of a series of attacks targeting the health infrastructure in Gaza. They held the US administration fully responsible for these violations and accused Washington of providing ""political cover"" for Israel by blocking international accountability mechanisms. Israel has claimed that Hamas is using civilian facilities, including hospitals, for military purposes. The militant group denies this."

Accessibility in online environments has been assessed by two key players - WebAIM, a nonprofit focused on enhancing the web experience for users with disabilities, and AudioEye, a company specialising in digital accessibility. Both reports cite travel websites as some of the worst offenders when it comes to accessibility. WebAIM’s ‘Million’ report assessed accessibility across the top 1,000,000 websites and found that, overall, travel websites had almost 60 errors on their homepage, a 17 per cent increase from last year. AudioEye’s Digital Accessibility Index identified issues too, with poor colour contrast, vague links and inaccessible forms cited as the most common errors. The World Health Organisation says one in six of the global population lives with some form of disability. At least 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment, with almost 400 million estimated to have a severe challenge with vision. An estimated 43 million people are registered as blind. “With around 20 per cent of the population reporting a disability, ignoring accessibility barriers can have a negative impact on a large population of potential customers and site visitors,” Jared Smith, executive director of WebAIM, explains to Euronews Travel. Much research has been done on the value of catering to disabled travelers. In the UK, the spending power of those with disabilities, known as the ‘purple pound,’ is estimated to exceed £50 billion (€58) in 2025. “Web accessibility is not only the right thing to do, it is also required by law,” Smith notes. “Because most travel websites have significant accessibility barriers, users with disabilities will spend their time and money at sites that have addressed accessibility issues.” Booking.com is the most visited travel website in the world, with over 500 million monthly visits. Yet it ranked 712,074th out of the million websites assessed, by far the lowest ranking out of all the major travel companies. Booking.com did not respond to a request for comment. Airbnb and Trip.com came in around halfway down the ranking, while Agoda ranked 377,532nd. The travel companies doing the best included Uber, ranking just over 8,000th, and Skyscanner, coming in at 1,113th.  For most of the errors detected, the most common problem was low contrast text, detected on 79.1 per cent of the homepages checked. Not providing ‘alternative text’ on images - a sentence describing what the image contains - was a problem for more than half the websites. Other common issues included missing labels for form inputs, empty links and empty buttons, all of which can make it hard for a visually impaired person to understand the content. Research from AudioEye found that 41 per cent of travel and hospitality websites made it hard for keyboard-only users to navigate, find information and make bookings. The report also found that colour contrast issues were highest in travel and hospitality across all business segments. Lucy Edwards lost sight in her right eye at age 11 due to a genetic condition. She lost the remainder of her sight at 17. Today, she’s an award-winning presenter, author and disability activist, committed to inclusivity across all industries. “Travel websites are almost always inaccessible,” Lucy tells Euronews Travel. “Images are not described via text, so I rely on my friends, family, and Husband to describe the beautiful scenes to me.” But it’s not just the beautiful travel images that people like Lucy miss out on. Problems arise when it comes to booking the trip when websites aren’t formatted for accessible reading. “It’s so infrequent that I can book a holiday independently,” Lucy says. “I’m always afraid I will book something wrong because there are so many pop-ups that disable my screen reader.” Screen readers are pieces of software that convert the text displayed on a computer screen into speech or, in some cases, even Braille. It’s a crucial piece of technology in enabling users with visual impairments or learning disabilities to access and interact with digital content. “Websites as a whole do not cater for screen reader users,” Lucy explains. “As a blind person, I feel frustrated every single day browsing the web.” The European Accessibility Act (EEA) will come into force on 28 June this year. It sets out standards across EU member states, aiming to remove barriers and ensure that people with disabilities can participate fully in society. While the EEA applies to more than just websites, a key component is making all websites trading in the EU accessible to everyone. Any company either based in the EU or that does business within the EU with at least 10 employees and a €2 million plus turnover will be expected to comply. Specifically, the law requires all websites to be perceivable, operable, understandable and robust for every user. It uses standards set out by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, commonly called WCAG, as a minimum requirement. In its most basic form of implementation, WCAG requires readable fonts with high contrast colour schemes, clear navigation with descriptive links, alternative text to be included for all images and video captions, and ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard accessible. Noncompliant companies could face fines and legal action, exclusion from procurement activities and negative publicity. “Overall the [web] experience has left me in tears,” Lucy confides to Euronews Travel. “I’m so lucky that I have sighted help, but it shouldn’t have to be this way.” Clearly, the EU agrees with this and is poised to make it uncomfortable for nonconforming businesses. With the EEA just weeks away, it’s time for travel firms to step up their game and make planning, booking and experiencing travel something everyone can enjoy."

Maybe older than Christ,” he says.  Located near Serpa, in the gently rolling hills of Alentejo in southeastern Portugal, his 30-hectare olive grove is part of a mosaic of oak and fruit trees, pastures and agricultural land that has been passed down through generations. From his family, Oliveira inherited his surname - which means “olive tree” in Portuguese - and the traditional landscape of montado, an agrosilvopastoral system that combines production and nature conservation. “Many of these trees are thousands of years old, but they are still bearing fruit. It’s a living museum,” he says with pride. Every year, visitors come to marvel at the monumental trees and to study the grove’s 17 different local olive varieties.  Oliveira has preserved a diverse landscape that is becoming increasingly rare in Alentejo, as super-intensive monoculture olive plantations expand, replacing traditional orchards. “It’s a staggering contrast. The only thing they have in common is that it’s the same species,” he says. Unlike his rain-fed olive grove with trees that have deep roots and a long lifespan, irrigated plantations can have up to 2,500 trees per hectare that are planted in uniform rows and last only a few decades.  These monoculture plantations use highly productive dwarf varieties adapted to mechanisation, achieving very high yields. However, they rely on irrigation, heavy machinery and agrochemicals, which lead to soil erosion and biodiversity loss. Across Alentejo, the uniform hedgerows of olives stretch as far as the eye can see. The area’s irrigated plantations have expanded rapidly in the last two decades with the supply of water from the Alqueva reservoir, the largest artificial lake in Western Europe.  Built with public funds, the dam was designed to bring economic growth to one of the continent’s poorest and driest regions. But the irrigation has mostly benefited large corporate groups profiting from super-intensive olive plantations. According to EDIA, the public company managing the Alqueva reservoir, more than 80 per cent of its water is used to irrigate intensive olive and almond plantations.  In 2024, it provided water to 74,059 hectares of olive groves, mostly super-intensive hedgerows. A few large companies like Elaia, De Prado and Aggraria - some of the world’s biggest olive oil producers - control the majority of the region’s irrigated land. The construction of the Alqueva dam on the Guadiana River, first proposed by dictator António de Oliveira Salazar in the 50s, flooded 25,000 hectares of land, destroying ecosystems and submerging the village of Luz as well as dozens of archaeological sites.  More than one million trees were felled. A few old trees were transplanted before the flooding, and now adorn gardens and squares across Alentejo, standing as the last remnants of a vanished landscape. Susana Sassetti, director of Olivum, an association representing olive producers with about 50,000 hectares of olive plantations, says that it was thanks to the Alqueva dam that Portugal became one of the world’s top exporters of olive oil.  Since the dam became operational in 2002, olive oil exports have increased 12-fold in volume and 18-fold in value, reaching about €900 million annually, she says. The intensification of olive oil production has been driven by the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) incentives and a global rise in olive oil demand. From 2007 to 2020, Portugal’s olive sector received over €1 billion in agricultural subsidies. EDIA’s president, José Pedro Salema, says the dam has an important strategic role in ensuring the region’s water supply, and has created jobs and attracted investment.  However, the highly mechanised intensive plantations rely mostly on seasonal and poorly paid migrant labour.  The dam has not stopped rural depopulation. Between 2011 and 2021, Alentejo lost over 52,000 residents, the largest population decline in Portugal. While Alqueva’s irrigation system and intensive olive plantations have been very profitable for investors in the short term, there are growing concerns about the environmental costs.  Scientists and environmentalists have warned that intensive olive farming in southern Portugal is transforming a once diverse landscape into monotonous rows of intensive plantations, damaging ecosystems and contaminating water and soil with agrochemicals. For Teresa Pinto Correia, a professor at the University of Évora who specialises in rural landscapes, public investments in the Alqueva dam have mostly benefited a small group of big companies and foreign investors. This has led to land concentration and an unequal distribution of water at artificially low prices. “The price of the water should account for the infrastructure, which includes not only the costs of building the dam but also the irrigation channels, water transportation, and the electricity needed to pump the water over long distances and to higher elevations, which is very expensive.” But this is not reflected in the price paid by users, she explains. The dam represents the largest public investment made in agriculture in Portugal’s modern history, at a cost of €2.5 billion. EDIA plans to expand irrigation to cover an additional 470 square kilometres, a project that will also be financed with public funds. “A lot of the companies [using Alqueva’s water] are investment funds focused on profit and completely detached from the territory. They are not thinking about passing on a sustainable future to the next generations” says Pinto Correia. She worries that these profits are being made at the expense of Alentejo’s natural resources, with little oversight or regulations. ZERO, a leading environmental organisation in Portugal, has condemned the unchecked spread of monoculture plantations in Alentejo.  Pedro Horta, ZERO’s policy officer, has documented many environmental violations and infractions, including the destruction of vital water networks, damage to protected areas and priority habitats, as well as harmful agricultural practices that are causing soil erosion and degradation. “Given the scale of the transformation of the landscape, we can call this an ecocide,” says Horta, pointing out that super-intensive plantations have led to significant biodiversity loss and environmental destruction.  A report published by EDIA found that intensive hedgerow plantations support only half the number of species found in traditional olive groves. Another study, by a team of researchers from different Portuguese universities, shows how the expansion of super-intensive agricultural systems is drastically reducing diversity and shrinking bird communities in Mediterranean olive orchards. For many, the current trajectory is unsustainable in a region increasingly affected by drought and extreme weather events.  A study by the consulting firm Agrogés predicts that climate change will increase water demand for irrigated olive groves by 5 per cent to 21 per cent, while average annual inflows to the Alqueva reservoir are expected to decrease by 5 per cent to 10 per cent by 2050. “We won’t have enough water,” says Pinto Correia. She fears that the simplification of ecosystems in homogeneous landscapes will make the region even more vulnerable to climate change. Resting in the shade of an ancient olive tree that has endured centuries of drought, storms and natural disasters, José Pedro Oliveira is confident that unlike irrigated plantations, his rain-fed olive grove will continue to bear fruit for generations to come. This project was supported by Climate Arena."

One father is finding out through play,"In their living room in South Korea, a father is using generative artificial intelligence (genAI) to turn his son's drawings into video clips and short stories as a new kind of playtime takes shape. Each week, the Kim family goes to the library to choose a book. They read it together, discuss a topic of interest, and build background knowledge. Knowing young children can’t engage with AI tools independently, father Kim Jungu prepares a short, 30-minute AI session by writing tailored prompts in advance. During the session, his five-year-old son Dohun engages with the AI through creative activities, such as designing an imaginary planet or writing a story set in the Orion constellation. The AI tutor contributes by asking follow-up questions and offering new information related to the topic. ""He really enjoys what I found because every time, the AI gives very interesting questions to him and also some great mathematical or scientific knowledge. So I believe that he feels he learns something every week,"" Kim, who works as a Chief Product Officer (CPO) at an IT firm, told Euronews Next. Dohun loves space and drawing. Kim believes AI is a useful tool that can answer questions parents can’t and helps his son to ""explore his imaginations and creativity"". ""I can see that his agenda is expanding. Last week, we explored solar systems. But right now, he is exploring the outer side of the solar system. AI continuously gives him some of the seeds of the idea,"" he added. While he thinks that it’s positive that AI can help expand children’s knowledge, he is aware of an overreliance on the technology. ""It’s also important that they don’t become overly dependent on it. As a parent, I think about how to guide that process carefully. Managing personal learning data is another concern,"" Kim said. AI education experts say the most important thing is the play itself, and parents should be mindful that the intensity of a session is appropriately timed according to their child’s age. ""They could just as well be playing with Legos…"" Kwon Jungmin, a professor who specialises in AI education at Seoul National University of Education, told Euronews Next. ""In my perspective, what they're playing with doesn't really matter as long as they're building a good relationship [even if] they're using AI as a medium,"" she continued. ""But if it was more frequent or if it was maybe more than two hours per day, that might be too much. It depends on the child's age and their interest"". Kwon says parents should make sure their children can discern between AI and humans. ""If the child is playing with AI by themselves, then that might be a problem because they would think that, for example, ChatGPT is a real living being,"" Kwon said. ""But when a parent is involved, what the parent thinks and how the parent interacts with the AI is important because kids learn through observing. So you have to watch really carefully what they're doing with AI, what the parents and the child are doing with AI"". Kwon says the focus should not be on AI alone. Instead, education in the AI era should nurture critical thinking by teaching kids subjects like humanities, literature, and philosophy.  ""What is more important is how does that child view ChatGPT,"" Kwon said. ""If the child does not have any educational experience on learning about how to view these technologies, then the child will just view it as someone with greater power and knowledge, and that will eventually lead to obeying the technology,"" she added. ""However, if the child has educational experience and learning about the philosophies; what is a human being? What does it mean to be living? What does it mean to be a human? With all that background knowledge and critical thinking, that child's perspective of AI will be very different from a child who has never learned about it. And that's the kind of people that we need right now"". Across South Korea, interest in AI education is booming. While some families like the Kims are exploring more organic, play-based approaches at home, schools, and private academies are integrating coding and AI literacy into their curricula.  Some are also using AI tracking systems to follow students’ learning progressions. ""The Korean private education market is big… that sector exists solely for college entrance exams. The college entrance exam is very important in Korea because it decides the social status of where you're going to be,"" Kwon said. According to a report from the South Korean government published in 2025, 47.6 per cent of children under 6 years old are receiving private education. In 2024, the average expenses spent on private education for school students reached an all-time high for the fourth consecutive year. ""So people, they invest a lot of money in their children's education so they could [reach a] higher status,"" Kwon added. In Europe, the EU's recently adopted AI Act - scheduled to come into effect from August 2027 - classifies AI systems as high risk for some areas of education, such as systems to evaluate learning outcomes, assessment of educational levels, and detection of students' prohibited behaviours, according to a report from the European Parliamentary Research Service. For Kim, it’s not about teaching technology early. It’s about creating space for his son to imagine, combine ideas, and explore. While experimenting with AI playtime at home, he began noticing how quickly private education was turning AI into a high-stakes race. He says the private education sector’s messaging, warning that kids without AI skills will be left behind, is rooted in fear.  ""It’s not about starting early out of fear,"" he wrote in a Treads post where he shares his AI playtime experience with other parents. ""It’s about nurturing creativity - exploring, combining, imagining. That matters more than the technology itself"". Instead, he believes in open dialogue and experience sharing in a system that leans heavily toward university admission exam preparation. ""We’re living in a world that’s changing fast. And the next 10 years our kids will live through will be completely different from what we’ve known,"" Kim said. ""If there’s a good educational method or tool, I think it’s important not to keep it to yourself but to share and talk about it with others so we can find better directions together,"" he added. Kim says he was encouraged by the number of parents who have reached out in response to the AI sessions he’s shared online. While concerns have been raised in Korea, Kwon thinks Europe is well placed to educate kids in AI. ""From the government perspective, the economy is important and the competition between the countries is important. However, for kids, no, they shouldn't worry about the economy,"" Kwon said.  ""We should worry about their critical thinking, which is more similar to the European model because the European model, they think critically about AI. They're late to adopt AI. But I think they have very good philosophical grounds to develop ethical AI,"" she added. In Europe, policymakers are introducing AI literacy into early education, often framing it as a foundational skill for the future.  A key goal is to ensure that access to this kind of education is equitable so that all children, regardless of background, can navigate an AI-driven world, a step UNESCO calls essential. The UK established an independent expert committee, the AI Council, in 2019 to advise the government on the AI ecosystem. The council says its vision is ""for everyone to be able to live confidently with AI"". In a report published in 2021, the council suggested that an online academy for understanding AI with trusted materials and initiatives would support teachers, school students, and lifelong learning. Kim thinks children need to know how to communicate with AI as it will be impossible for them to avoid it from school to everywhere else. ""My idea is they need to know how they can leverage AI for their creativity and their education,"" he said. ""Children have really a lot of great potential. But it [can be] really hard to, as adults, to [keep up with] their potential for creativity,"" Kim added. ""AI could give them [children] knowledge so that they can expand their creativity. Because creativity comes from curiosity. But I believe that creativity can grow from knowledge. So I found the potential that AI could help out [with] creative growth"".

Real-time price updates on a screen and stocks changing hands at the click of a button—this is the face of modern trading, be it in Tokyo, London, or New York. But, how did it all get started? It turns out that modern stock trading traces its roots back to a Dutch trading company over four centuries ago.  On 20 March 1602, the Dutch East India Company (‘Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie’ in Dutch) or the VOC announced the first initial public offering (IPO), laying a foundation for modern financial markets. Article 10 of its charter said: “All the residents of these lands may buy shares in this Company”. The idea of investments predates the launch of the VOC's IPO. Dutch historian Marteen Prak told Euronews that before the VOC, companies followed a traditional model where merchants pooled money into single trade voyages within Europe or overseas. “After the trip, the accounts would be settled and people would, well, in case of a profit or at least a sort of positive result, get their investment back. And then of course, they could reinvest in the next trip and so on,” he added.  However, the VOC was a pioneer in two particular aspects. Firstly, the stock ownership was open to all without any set minimum investment amount, and secondly, shares were tradable. Dutch historian and economist Lodewijk Petram noted in his book, The World’s First Stock Exchange, that a provision had been added to the first page of the charter after its initial granting. It said, “Conveyance or transfer [of shares] may be done through the bookkeeper of this chamber”. This paved the way for a secondary market. Investors had the option to trade the shares with someone else instead of keeping their money locked up for years. Trading took place at three key locations: the New Bridge, where merchants conducted the world’s first share transactions in the open air; the Hendrick de Keyser Exchange, a purpose-built marketplace for commodities and shares; and Dam Square, where after-hours trading continued based on the latest news and rumours.   The IPO registration was open throughout the month of August. A sum of 3,674,945 guilders was raised from the 1,143 initial investors. One of them was Neeltgen Cornelis, who worked as a maid for one of the owners of the VOC. She invested 100 guilders, a hard-earned sum when her wage amounted to 50 cents a day.  “This was very usual and not exceptional at all,” Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden told Euronews. While the move made by Cornelis might surprise people in today's context, it was fairly standard for the time. “There were a lot of shares being traded and invested by, well, normal households, a carpenter or a farmer,” van Zanden said. He also explained that letting ordinary people invest was a condition set by Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, then Grand Pensionary of the Dutch Republic. This was before the pre-companies that merged into the VOC joined together as one large corporation.  “The idea was, let’s put them all together and create a more powerful company—not only commercially but also militarily,” Marteen Prak told Euronews, describing the VOC’s formation as a deliberate power move. “The Netherlands was attempting to gain its independence from the King of Spain, because they were all ruled by the same crown- Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands. So it was also seen as a form of warfare against the Spanish Empire in Asia,” he said.  This long-term vision had its drawbacks — notably a lack of cash in hand for investors. For almost a decade since the launch of their IPO, the VOC did not pay any dividends, leading to rising discontent among its shareholders. On top of this, another development was creating pressure on the company — the world's first short seller.  In 1608, Isaac Le Maire, a disgruntled former director of the VOC, led what is now considered the world’s first bear raid. Le Maire and his syndicate used forward contracts to bet against the VOC share prices.  These contracts, similar to modern-day futures, allowed investors to agree on a sale price in advance, expecting to profit when the actual price dropped. Unlike today, no collateral was required—just a written agreement was enough to strike a deal. This organised attack exacerbated the frustration among investors waiting years for returns, putting pressure on the VOC. Finally, in August 1609, the company announced its first dividend. It was not cash money.  “They used the surplus of mace, which was difficult to sell at the market at the time,” Professor van Zanden explained, noting how the VOC distributed a spice from the nutmeg tree cultivated in the East Indies . “It was a kind of compromise solution,” he added.  Starting in 1623, the VOC paid dividends every two years, then more regularly from 1635—often annually or semi-annually. In the 1630s and 1640s, dividends were mostly cloves, which shareholders accepted gladly. From 1646, dividends were mostly in cash, with occasional bond distributions. This maintained shareholder confidence and allowed prices to steadily rise.  Professor Prak also described the decline of the VOC in the late 18th century, attributing it to the rise of French and British colonial powers. “It became increasingly expensive for the Dutch Republic and also for the VOC to hold off their rivals,” the historian said. “When it became clear that it would go bankrupt, the Dutch government bought all the shares.” Pioneering key financial innovations since its inception, the VOC laid the cornerstone for today’s capital markets. For the following two centuries, it remained a key player in global trade, until its gradual decline.    “This [the VOC’s tenure] is a long time of good success,” said Professor van Zanden. “And the failure at the end of the 18th century is related to the general weakening of dominance with the rise of competitors,” he added."

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha accused each other of attacking energy sites, speaking at different panels at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum in Turkey. Lavrov said that Russia hasn’t attacked any Ukrainian energy facilities since 18 March, when Russian President Vladimir Putin was said to have agreed to halt attacks for 30 days in a phone call with US President Donald Trump. Lavrov accused Ukraine of breaking the terms of the US-brokered deal and said he provided the list of energy sites targeted by Ukraine to the various parties involved in diplomatic efforts. ""We have been keeping the word. And the Ukrainians have been attacking us from the very beginning every passing day, maybe with two or three exceptions,” said Lavrov. “I gave to our colleagues from Turkey, to (Foreign) Minister (Hakan) Fidan, what we give to Americans, to UN and to OSCE, the list of facts, listing the attacks by Ukraine during the last three weeks against Russian energy infrastructure."" Sybiha contested Lavrov's claims, accusing Russia of not being serious about peace, claiming that the Kremlin had launched thousands of projectiles at Ukraine in the last few weeks. ""Russia escalated terror and fought, I have statistics with me, and fought almost 70 missiles, over 2,000 Shahed drones, and over 6,000 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, mostly at civilians. This clearly shows to the world who wants peace and who wants war,"" said Sybiha. Lavrov also warned that a potential Black Sea deal could only be implemented after issues with insurance, trade, and access to ports for Russian organisations are resolved. Details of the prospective deal were not released, but it appeared to mark another attempt to ensure safe Black Sea shipping after a 2022 agreement brokered by the UN and Turkey but halted by Russia the following year. ""This time, when President Trump suggested that another Black Sea deal, Putin said, yeah, we are ready, but we need to draw lessons from the past,” said Lavrov. “Let's resolve the things on trade, insurance, calling on the ports. The Americans took this, and they are considering. They didn't come back to us after this,” he added. Russia’s top diplomat said Washington has been considering Moscow’s demands but has yet to reply to them. The White House said in March that the US “will help restore Russia’s access to the world market for agricultural and fertiliser exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that “we’re going to evaluate” the Russian conditions, noting that some of them “include sanctions that are not ours, they belong to the European Union.” However, Russia has no military control over the Black Sea, which raises questions about the meaningfulness of the latest US-brokered deal."

This marks the second consecutive year that the company has opted out of whaling during the summer season. Although Hvalur is not the only whaling company in Iceland, it is by far the largest, holding a permit for the hunting of 200 fin whales this season. Its CEO, Kristján Loftsson, says his staff have been informed of the decision, which was made due to the global economic situation. “Given the current economic situation, Hvalur HF sees no other option but to stay docked and wait for better days. The situation will be reassessed next year,” said Loftsson, speaking to Icelandic media. Loftsson says the economic situation in Japan – where Hvalur HF sells almost all of its products – such as inflation, have reached a point where whaling is no longer economically viable. “The product price developments in our main market, Japan, have been unfavourable recently and are getting worse,” he said. “The price of our products is now so low that it is not justifiable to hunt.” Last year, whaling did not take place either. In a highly politicised move, Svandís Svavarsdóttir, who was then the Left-Green Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, issued the season’s permit only one day before it was scheduled to begin. Loftsson says that late issuance of the permit made it impossible for the company to properly plan and execute their operations in 2024. Whaling remains a hot-button issue in Iceland, with the general public essentially split on whether or not they support the practice. Iceland, Norway, and Japan are currently the only countries that still permit the controversial practice of whaling. The whaling season in Iceland typically runs from mid-June to September. However, in recent years, Icelandic whalers have been struggling to meet their quotas. Iceland’s second largest whaling company, IP-Utgerd ceased operations in 2020, citing declining profits and demand for whale meat facilitated by the COVID-19 pandemic."

They danced the Polonaise in historic costumes, sang the national anthem, invoked their Catholic beliefs and chanted slogans in support of a conservative candidate running in next month's presidential election. The march of thousands was supported by the Law and Justice party, the conservative populists who governed Poland for eight years until 2023, when a centrist, pro-European Prime Minister Donald Tusk took over. Law and Justice is hoping to regain power in the next general election. In the meantime it is fighting to elect an ally as president who is commander-in-chief and has influence over foreign policy and veto power over laws. Law and Justice leader Jarosław Kaczyński called on “all patriots” to join the march, which culminated in a gathering in front of the Royal Castle where the party's candidate, 42-year-old Karol Nawrocki, spoke to a supportive crowd. The castle, rebuilt after it was destroyed by Germans during World War II, is a symbol of the nation's history and resilience. Nawrocki, who was a historian turned politician, said Poland must safeguard ""this heritage, this beauty, this crown that was given to us.” ”We want a Poland with aspirations, with dreams, because we are committed to those who came before us and to those who will come after us,” Nawrocki said. ""We want a great Poland!” A few US flags were waved in the march amid a sea of Polish flags, as some supporters present at the rally expressed their support for US President Donald Trump. One of them, Stanislaw Bieniek, 81, said he fled communist Poland for the US, where he gained citizenship. “My whole family voted for Trump, and now I live here and I will vote for Nawrocki,” he said. The rally comes as the Law and Justice party seeks to drum up support for their candidate, Nawrocki, who’s been trailing in polls behind front-runner liberal candidate, Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. Nawrocki has also been fighting the rise of a challenger from the far-right Confederation party. Sławomir Mentzen, who’s been growing in popularity poses a major threat to the Law and Justice party’s hold over the country’s sizeable conservative electorate. Saturday’s event was a celebration of the millennium anniversary of the coronation of Poland’s first king, Bolesław the Brave. His coronation in 1025 was a historic moment, held dear to many Poles as it affirmed the country’s national independence. The rally also celebrated another historic anniversary, marking the 500th year since the Ducy of Prussia paid formal allegiance to the Polish king in 1525. That has emotional resonance for some in a country that suffered German aggression for significant periods in its history. Organisers estimated 100,000 people took part, though city hall — run by Trzaskowski — placed the number at 20,000. Trzaskowski has been polling at over 30%, while Nawrocki trails behind at just over 20%. The two joined a debate on Friday seeking to energise their traditional electorates and win new votes. The Polish presidential election is set for 18 May. Poland uses an absolute majority system in its elections. If no candidate secures more than the 50% threshold required to win, a runoff between the top two candidates. The incumbent, Andrzej Duda, who serves as an independent is an ally of the conservative Law and Justice. His second and final term ends this summer, and is no longer eligible to run for office."

The Hungarian Two-Tailed Dog Party's peace march was apparently against diversity and for uniformity, with participants dressed in grey. But the real message was that the government's policies are exclusionary and harmful. Participants marched along the route of the peace march behind a banner reading Illiberal Pride, which, when viewed on a map, looked peculiarly like male genitalia. One participant told Euronews why he had come to the event: ""I feel that our rights are being taken away and I think we have to stand up to stop that from happening. Because I have to grow up in this country, I have a little brother, he has to grow up and if I want to have children, I want to raise him here. And I would like them to have rights in the future, and if they decide to do whatever they want with their lives, they can do it."" Meanwhile, government supporters held a protest in Buda's Millenáris Park over a speech by Tisza Party MEP Kinga Kollár, which Prime Minister Viktor Orbán compared to Ferenc Gyurcsány's speech at the Kremlin. Kollár spoke at an EP committee meeting in Brussels about the effectiveness of withholding EU funds in Hungary, while the deterioration of living standards in Hungary strengthens the opposition. Speakers at the demonstration, government publicists Zsolt Bayer and Bence Apáti, as well as Gergely Gulyás, the minister in charge of the prime ministership, called Kollár's words ""unacceptable"", and similar sentiments were echoed by the demonstration participants. One of them told Euronews: ""This country of ten million people is unbelievable how many uninformed and evil people it carries on its back. And when the two meet, it destroys countries. That's why we are here now, whatever the party. I came in from the countryside."" On stage, Zsolt Bayer called the president of the Tisza Party, Péter Magyar, a paid agent of Brussels, and Gergely Gulyás called him a traitor."

On Thursday, Pope Francis visited St. Peter's Basilica to check the progress of the restoration of two funerary monuments, those of Popes Paul III and Urban VIII, whose works will be presented on Sunday. Before moving on to the tomb of Pius X, where he gathered in prayer, the pope, who was wearing trousers and a poncho instead of his usual white suit, met two restorers who were on site to carry out the final touches. He had them called by the Vatican gendarmerie and thanked them in person. The Pope is still recovering after a long stay at the Gemelli polyclinic with double pneumonia. Nonetheless, he met the British royals on Wednesday during an unscheduled interview as they visited Rome. Last Sunday, he appeared in St. Peter's Square at the end of the mass for the Jubilee of the sick and healthcare workers."

A recent extraordinary scientific discovery is proof of this. During the filming of a documentary on the region's geomorphological landscape, scientists found important palaeontological evidence in the countryside around Baunei, in Ogliastra: fossil traces testifying to the presence of dinosaurs in Sardinia. The discovery was made by a scientific team composed of professors Antonio Assorgia, Sergio Ginesu and Stefania Sias, former lecturers at the Universities of Sassari and Cagliari. Preserved in rocks dating back to the Jurassic period, the footprints belong to a theropod dinosaur never previously reported in Sardinia. Thanks to the extraordinary discovery, it has been possible to reconstruct the animal's appearance and the environment in which it lived. The dinosaur was a biped from the Middle Jurassic period, around 165 million years ago, and lived along stretches of coastline with sandy and muddy sediments, typical of marshy and tidal areas. This was explained by experts at a press conference on Friday. The rocky surface where the dinosaur's footprints were found also provided evidence of the presence of other coeval species. This is therefore the first evidence of the presence of dinosaurs in the Mesozoic period in Sardinia. Stefania Sias, the first to notice those tracks, said the dinosaur discovered was named 'Bibi', and would be a female specimen, although we have to wait for scientific evidence to ascertain this. ""The footprints speak to us and tell us how things were 165 million years ago, the one from Baunei was probably a herbivore, given the lack of claws, and was a biped about 120 160 centimetres long,"" said palaeontologist and lecturer at the University of Sassari, Marco Zedda, speaking at the conference and explaining how from just a footprint, one can reconstruct the animal that left it. According to Francesco Ginesu, Sole Director of the MGB company and responsible for the production of the documentary, this is an exceptional discovery, and emerged almost by chance. ""As often happens in science, it has the power to radically change what we thought we knew,"" said Ginesu, adding that ""those footprints, spotted while working on a popularised product, turned out to be a finding of enormous scientific value. It is not just one more piece of data: it is direct evidence of the presence of dinosaurs in an area that until now had not yielded such clear evidence."""

US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi ""briefly spoke in the presence of the Omani foreign minister,"" according to Iranian media. Aragachi said the next round of talks would take place on April 19th. He described negotiations as constructive. American officials did not immediately acknowledge the Iranian reports. While no agreement is likely in the immediate future, the stakes are high for the two countries closing in on almost half a century of animosity. Tension between Washington and Tehran has escalated in recent months. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. The negotiations are especially important in the context of ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Senior Iranian officials have emphasised that Tehran is conducting these negotiations with serious intentions. Iranian officials have stressed that Tehran ""will not accept giving up its nuclear program for peaceful purposes"" as part of any potential agreement. Ali Shamkhani, political adviser to the Iranian Supreme Leader, said the problem could be resolved if the US showed sincerity and political will. US officials invited Tehran to reach a deal that achieves stability, based on the principle that ""peace is power."" Oman has been pursuing quiet diplomacy for years, enabling it to play the key role of meditator. Its unique history, people and proximity to Iran have made it indispensable for the West as it has held discussion after discussion for Iran."

Video acquired by AnewZ shows what authorities say is border guards observing three unidentified individuals illegally crossing from Iran into Azerbaijan. The border post was alerted and the three individuals were ordered to stop. Warning shots were fired.  The suspects reportedly ignored the warnings and opened fire at the border guards.  According to the State Border Service, the border guards responded with gunfire of their own. One suspect was killed, one apprehended and the third fled back over the Iranian border.  A search of the area led to the discovery of a rifle, a night vision device, spent casings and three large packages containing a total of 32.4 kilograms of cannabis.  Azerbaijan’s State Border Service said it has launched an investigation and notified Iranian border officials. "

The move could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren’t usually made in the US. A notice shared by US Customs and Border Protection said the exemption also applies to the 145% tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, and includes other electronic devices and components, including semiconductors, solar cells and memory cards. This would benefit American tech giants like Apple, which has 90% of its iPhone production and assembly based in China, according to Wedbush Securities. The new exemption applies to products that entered the United States or were removed from warehouses from 5 April. It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. The goal is to encourage more domestic manufacturing. But the exemptions seem to acknowledge that the current electronics supply chain is virtually all in Asia and it will be challenging to shift that to the US. President Donald Trump's administration has been predicting its barrage of tariffs targeting China will push Apple into manufacturing the iPhone in the United States for the first time. But that's an unlikely scenario even with US tariffs now standing at 145% on products made in China — Apple has manufactured most of its iPhones there since the first model hit the market 18 years ago. The disincentives for Apple shifting its production domestically include a complex supply chain that it began building in China during the 1990s. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the US, and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product."

Speaking at the opening ceremony, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed his hope that the event would help restore global unity in a world plagued by conflicts and trade wars.  “The world, having overcome the coronavirus pandemic, is now threatened by an array of divisions,” Ishiba said.   “At a time like this, it is extremely meaningful that people from around the world gather here and discuss the theme of life and experience cutting-edge technology, diverse ideas and culture.”  Around 1,300 people, including the Japanese emperor, attended the opening ceremony.  Futuristic exhibitions will be showcased in dozens of pavilions with unique designs. About 180 countries, regions and organisations will be hosted in the city during the exposition.  It is Osaka's second world expo after the 1970 event, which was a huge success and attracted 64 million visitors — a record until Shanghai broke it in 2010.  World expos are huge international events where countries from around the globe come together to showcase innovation, culture, technology and ideas for the future.

Italy, Spain, Greece, Cyprus and Malta were represented, as well as the European Commissioner for Home Affairs and Migration Magnus Brunner and Frontex Executive Director Hans Leijtens. At the end of the summit, the ministers signed a joint declaration. ""We all recognised the need to strengthen Frontex,"" said Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi during the press conference at the end of the summit, reiterating that ""the fight against human traffickers is always a priority"". ""It is also our intention to work on assisted voluntary returns, a measure that we consider crucial, especially if it is supported by concrete actions to help returnees with their economic and social reintegration in their countries of origin,"" Piantedosi added. According to the minister, it is a priority for the European Union to maintain an adequate level of funding and to ""launch a specific initiative on assisted voluntary returns as soon as possible, in order to take a qualitative leap forward and outline a real common strategy."" Responding to a question from journalists on the transfer of irregular migrants to Albania, the minister claimed that these were individuals considered to be dangerous. ""Out of the 40 people transported to Albania, there are as many as five cases of convictions for sexual violence, one case of attempted murder, they had previous convictions for weapons, property crimes, theft, resisting a public official, personal injuries,"" Piantedosi said. ""There is a large sample of precedents, which allows us to identify the characterisation of people judged to be dangerous and, as such, subject to detention, as provided for by our law,"" he added, explaining the reason for handcuffing the immigrants while they disembarked from the ship that arrived in Albania on Friday. ""Among the reasons for which these containment measures are put in place is to protect the safety of police officers as well, which as far as I am concerned always remains in first place. Ministers Matteo Piantedosi (Italy), Nicholas A. Joannides (Deputy Minister Cyprus), Makis Voridis (Greece), Byron Camilleri (Malta) and Fernando Grande-Marlaska Gómez (Spain) reaffirmed in their joint declaration their commitment to develop a common political vision on the most relevant issues of the European migration agenda. They also reaffirmed the importance of the European Pact on Migration and Asylum and committed themselves to its effective implementation, while also calling for immediate and unconditional funding based on needs to support the necessary fulfilment of the Pact's obligations within the current multiannual financial framework. At the same time, they demanded increased allocations for the internal and external dimensions of asylum, migration and border management within the next MFF, in line with the increasingly heavy burdens on frontline Member States and in consideration of the fact that external borders are managed by them for the good of the whole Union. The focus of Member States and European institutions, according to the Med5 ministers, must remain on exploring appropriate innovative solutions to address irregular migration, including new ways to prevent and counter irregular migration, manage asylum and return, in line with EU and international law and ensuring sustainable solutions. ""We emphasise that an effective return policy is vital for a well-functioning asylum system and therefore indispensable for the integrity of the European Pact on Migration and Asylum,"" they said while welcoming the European Commission's efforts to increase the efficiency of the return process by providing member states with common standards for effective return management. ""We also call on the European Commission to launch, in the framework of the Global Alliance against Smuggling of Migrants, a specific initiative on assisted voluntary returns from third countries of transit to migrants' countries of origin, including the organisation of an international conference,"" the ministers added, reiterating that conditions must be created for communities and individuals to live in safety and dignity in their countries. ""The respect of human rights is the most important pillar for us because the respect of these rights is a cornerstone of the values of the European Union,"" said Spanish minister Grande-Marlaska. Regarding the migrant centres in Albania, he explained that it is necessary to know what the European institutions think."

Klitschko said drones hit a private house and a non-residential building, injuring at least three people. Footage from Ukraine's State Emergency Service showed crews still trying to put out fires after sunrise. It said three warehouses across the city caught fire in the attack. It came amid wider strikes on several Ukrainian regions. The general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said Russia launched 88 drones at targets across the country, 56 of which were downed. In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, one person sustained minor injuries because of Russian drone strikes there, according to mayor Ihor Terekhov. Ukraine's Khortytsia operational-strategic group, a formation of the Ukrainian Ground Forces, reported on Saturday that Russian forces are regrouping to prepare for a renewed military offensive in the Kharkiv region. They said in a statement that although no offensive actions were taken so far, Russian troops are replenishing their units to resume operations. European countries vowed Friday to send €21 billion in further funding to help Ukraine keep fighting Russia’s invasion. At the same time, US envoy Steve Witkoff was in St. Petersburg to pursue peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said Witkoff's meeting with Putin lasted 4 1/2 hours, and cited the Kremlin as saying that the two discussed “aspects"" of ending the war, without providing any details. Russian forces hold the advantage in Ukraine, with the war now in its fourth year. Ukraine has endorsed a US ceasefire proposal, but Russia has effectively blocked it by imposing far-reaching conditions. European governments have accused Putin of dragging his feet. The Russian delay in accepting Washington's proposal has frustrated Trump and fuelled doubts about whether Putin really wants to stop the fighting and end the more than three-year war."

A writer's profits from any book sold are usually between 5 and 15% of the book's retail price. Bestselling authors can count on a percentage of 25% of the price, but they are in the minority. Distribution, production and dealer markup generate costs, but a sizable portion of the income from the work goes into the publisher's pocket. Debut authors are often left with the only option of either self-publishing or co-publishing their work. In Poland, this issue has sparked fierce debate online recently due to a lawsuit launched by bestselling author Joanna Kuciel-Frydryszak. The writer of ""Chłopki"" (""The Peasants"") is taking action against the publishing house Marginesy over what she claims are the disproportionately high profits the firm makes in relation to what she's paid. The author's reportage about the lives and hard times of contemporary peasant Polish women, their grandmothers and great-grandmothers has been a huge success. Five months after its publication, the book's been reprinted 12 times, and at the end of last year, Marginesy reported that it had sold more than half a million copies. Now, Kuciel-Frydryszak wants more money from the publishing house, wanting to take advantage of the so-called 'bestseller clause', which was amended in September 2024. It says that ""if the remuneration of the author is disproportionately low in relation to the benefits of the buyer of the author's economic rights or the licensee, the author may demand an appropriate increase in remuneration by the court"". Following her statement, the subsequent online debate exploded with an avalanche of comments and remarks referring to the disproportion between the publishers' receipts and what actually ends up in the authors' pockets. Siding with the writer's, among others, was Jakub Żulczyk, one of the most widely read Polish writers, and a member of the board of the Polish Literary Union. Natalia Zacharek, author of several anthropological and popular science books, tells Euronews that authors should be much better paid, in Poland, and in general. Even at a well-known publishing house, she gets less than 1.5% of profits from sales. ""I can no longer remember if it was 0.5% or 1.5% on sales,"" she says. ""It was on the basis of popularising the subject because I cared, but I was very disappointed because I thought I would get more for a book of my own authorship."" The publisher has been paying her for five years and, she says, she has collected ""maybe a few thousand zlotys"" (about one thousand euros) from this. ""It is impossible to make a living from writing books in Poland,"" says the author, who publishes her books in both commercial and museum publishing houses. In response to the ongoing row between Polish authors and their publishing houses, author Jakub Żulczyk founded his own publishing platform NEWHOMERS in 2022, which advertised itself initially as a place to publish podcasts, but it quickly expanded its publishing model. It aims to give authors fairer deals, rather than taking a higher cut of the profits. A recent advert that appeared on the job portal rocketjobs speaks for itself - ""if you know how to make things up', or 'tell the truth in an engaging way', a new publishing platform might be something you're looking for."" While an increasing number of authors are choosing alternative ways to go public, such as self-publishing or co-publishing a book, such a path is difficult and requires an investment of time and money. ""Someone might say that she [Joanna Kuciel-Frydryszak] could have self-published her book, but then there would be no promotion at all. I hope this case will change something in the attitude of publishing houses towards writers,"" says Zacharek."

Secretary General Mark Rutte warned of the possibility in an interview with German newspaper Welt am Sonntag. He said Moscow's capabilities in space are outdated in comparison with the West. ""Therefore, the development of nuclear weapons in space is a way for Russia to improve its capabilities. This is very worrying."" Although the weapons would not target Earth, shooting down satellites could have serious consequences, as many systems we use rely on satellites, including navigation and communication systems, as well as environmental monitoring. Rutte added that such a move by Russia would violate the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, signed by the United States and the Soviet Union at the time. It still provides the framework of international space law and prohibits the deployment of weapons of mass destruction in space. According to Rutte, NATO allies are adapting to the new challenges, exchanging intelligence and developing better protected satellites. ""In recent years, space has become increasingly crowded, dangerous, and unpredictable. We know that competition in space is fierce and becoming increasingly bitter. And not just in commercial terms. This affects our entire security,"" he said."

Abu Osama Bahar said he’s been displaced fifteen times since the war began in 2023. He is now uncertain where to go with his young children.  “What did we do in this world for this to happen to us? We’re all civilians. All are woman and children fleeing,” he said.  The IDF issued orders Friday morning for Palestinians to immediately evacuate the areas of Shajiyah, Turkman, Zaytoun and Tuffah.  Since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas collapsed last month, Israel has issued several evacuation orders across Gaza. Many Palestinians in the north of the Gaza Strip face a choice of whether to stay despite the danger or yet again face displacement.  “We’re calling for Muslims. Have mercy on us,” said Amer al-Reefy, who was displaced from eastern Gaza. “Please have mercy on us. We’ve been displaced a billion times and we don’t know where to go.”  Israel embarked on a major bombing campaign after the ceasefire collapsed and seized territory in what they say is an attempt to compel Hamas to release more hostages.  Nearly 400,000 people were forced to move following the renewed assault, according to the United Nations.  The war in Gaza started after Hamas fighters carried out an attack on southern Israel on 7 October, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians. 251 hostages were taken, most of whom have since been released as part of negotiations between the two parties. 59 hostages remain, 24 of which are believed to still be alive."

""First Woman: NASA's Promise to Humanity"", which was initially published in 2021, revolves around Commander Callie Rodriguez, who leads a diverse space crew to the moon. As of Friday, the book — once free to download — no longer appears on NASA's website. Nor does its sequel, ""First Woman: Expanding our Universe"". However, an app developed to accompany the book still appears in Apple's App Store. Since the start of Donald Trump's second term in January, NASA has been complying with instructions from the White House to remove all references to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. After Trump issued an executive order in January instructing agencies, departments and federal workers both to shut down all DEI programmes and to report on any colleagues who might attempt to “disguise these programmes by using coded or imprecise language” in workplace communications. NASA was one of several agencies to send out a memo to all staff based on a template from the Office of Personnel Management that claimed DEI programmes ""divided Americans by race, wasted taxpayer dollars, and resulted in shameful discrimination"". “The Biden Administration forced illegal and immoral discrimination programs, going by the name ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI), into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government, in areas ranging from airline safety to the military,” the letter read. “That ends today. Americans deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great.” In March, NASA heavily watered down the public remit of its Artemis programme, which initially promised to take people other than white American men to the Moon. “NASA will land the first woman, first person of colour, and first international partner astronaut on the Moon using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before,"" the site previously read. Today, that sentence is missing. Euronews Culture has contacted NASA for comment. Other agencies that have removed content related to ""diversity"" from their websites include the National Park Service, which restored a page related to abolitionist and Underground Railroad leader Harriet Tubman that had been removed in favour of a heavily watered-down page on ""black/white cooperation"". The service said the page had been removed in error."

Large-scale war returned to European soil. Aside from Western support for Ukraine, Germany's own military has come back into the country's focus - reigniting debate over the state of the Bundeswehr. One topic that has resurfaced in recent months is the debate around reintroducing compulsory military service. In 2011, then-CSU Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg suspended conscription, citing cost concerns. Although conscription is not set to be reinstated immediately under the new coalition agreement between the CDU/CSU and the SPD, the shortage of personnel in the armed forces remains a pressing issue. Several weeks ago, 31-year-old soldier and content creator David Matei appeared on German talk-show panel Hart aber Fair. He acknowledged that the Bundeswehr has its flaws, challenges and problems ""that we need to tackle,"" but added, ""for me, Germany is one of the most successful democracies of our time. Germany is worth it!"" Matei is not only an active-duty soldier, he's also an influencer. His goal is to bring security policy closer to Gen Z. Euronews spoke with the 31-year-old about his career and the ability of social media to help bridge the gap between young people and the Bundeswehr. Euronews: We are about the same age, I had no connection to the Bundeswehr when I was young. How did you decide to join the army when you were 18? David Matei: There are photos of me from fourth grade where I'm dressed head-to-toe in camouflage: camouflage Converse, a green rucksack, hydrogen-blonde hair, and holding a softair pistol while giving a military salute. Back then, it was just cool to run around the woods with the boys, playing and pretending to be soldiers. That phase faded once I hit puberty. I never had a personal or family connection to the Bundeswehr. My dad had to do military service in Romania because of the Warsaw Pact. He often spoke about that time - about the harassment he endured, like scrubbing the floor with a toothbrush, the kind of classic humiliations we know from films or stories. Those accounts left me with a negative impression of military service. When I turned 18, I didn't even really know what compulsory military service was. Then a letter from the Bundeswehr arrived. Suddenly, I had to confront the topic for the first time. I felt the same way as all the boys sitting with me in the back row of the classroom. We'd all received this letter, and agreed on one thing: we wanted to decide for ourselves what to do after school. We didn't want anyone telling us what path to take. It was this very basic instinct, the moment you're forced to do something, you instantly don’t want to do it. I see that feeling in a lot of young people today - and I really get it. The other guys already knew what they wanted to do after their high school examinations. I didn't. So I took another look at the Bundeswehr flyer. I had rejected it outright before, even called them up and said: ""I can't, I've got an ingrown toenail, I don't want to, it's just not for me!"" But there it was again, the flyer. And honestly? The first thing that caught my eye was the salary. The second was this vague sense of adventure, doing something different, getting out, leaving home. So I called the district recruitment office again and said: ""Hey, my toenail's growing straight again. Got any use for me after all?"" Next thing I knew, I was off to the medical assessment. I wanted to join the mountain troops. But that wasn't so easy, I had to cheat my way in a bit. Back then, I was skinny and an emo: long, jet-black dyed hair, straightened every day with a €20 flat iron, ten kilos of hairspray and eyeliner. Midway through the medical exam, I ran to the toilet in just my underwear, hung myself over the sink and drank so much water I got a stomach ache. Then I rushed back to the army doctor and onto the scale. She looked at me and said: ""Sorry, still half a kilo too light."" I asked her: ""Can't we work something out? Isn't there an exception?"" She told me I'd have to promise to eat properly and exercise. In the end, I was classified as T2, not the top fitness level (that would’ve been T1), but good enough. I ended up getting a place with the mountain troops and signed up for nine months. Of course, my low weight didn't go unnoticed. I was surrounded by big, strong soldiers and, just like in a cliché Hollywood movie, I was the one struggling to keep up at the back of the formation. The beginning was really tough. But at some point, I had my little ""glow-up"", and it actually started to be fun. Alongside our mountain infantry training, we had a lot of political and ethical education during basic training. We spent a lot of time studying the soldier's oath, our loyalty to the Federal Republic of Germany and the duty to bravely defend the rights and freedom of the German people. Of course, the training in the mountains was intense and exciting, but what gave it real meaning for me was knowing it served a higher purpose: for our country and for our free and democratic constitutional order. In the end, that's what made me decide to extend my service to 15 years. I always say: I came for the money, but stayed for the free and democratic basic order. Euronews: Before the Russian attack on Ukraine, I think many young people had a negative image of the Bundeswehr. How did your friends and family react when you signed up for 15 years? David: At first, people around me barely took notice. When word got out in the final weeks of school that I was joining the Bundeswehr, and not just that, but the mountain troops, most people couldn't believe it. They'd say things like: ""You won't last three days. Only elite soldiers make it into the mountain troops! What are you doing there with your long black hair and skinny jeans?"" My head of year even said in front of the whole class that I'd be running home to my mum crying after three days. That really stuck with me. Later, when I was on the verge of giving up during basic training, I kept thinking back to that moment. It pushed me to keep going. In terms of how soldiers are perceived, I remember being treated more positively in the US as a German soldier than I ever was back home. When I was 18 or 21 and visiting the States, people would come up to me in bars and say: ""Thanks for your service."" During one deployment, we were walking through Times Square in New York City in uniform and people kept stopping us to say thank you - even police officers wanted to take pictures with us. That left an impression. Of course, I sometimes wish there was that kind of appreciation here in Germany too. At the same time, I think it's good that people in a democracy like Germany are critical of the armed forces. That's why we have things like the parliamentary reservation and the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces. But a lot has changed - especially since Russia's full-scale invasion. The current Parliamentary Commissioner summed it up well in her latest report: ""We've gone from a 'friendly disinterest' to an 'interested friendliness'."" I notice that in everyday life, too. I used to think ""Oh no"" whenever someone honked at me while I was in uniform. Now, it's often a thumbs-up, a smile, a nod. Just recently, someone even knocked on my car window at a red light to thank me for my service. I was a bit confused at first, but honestly - it was just nice. Older people often say: ""I was a soldier too"", and then tell stories about their own time in the army, about the Cold War. With younger people, I sense real curiosity, probably because they no longer have any personal connection to the Bundeswehr. Most of them don’t know anyone in the military. They ask: ""Wait, you're in the Bundeswehr? That's wild. What do you actually do all day?"" The older generation usually talks about themselves. The younger ones ask questions. That's why I create content, to help bridge that gap. Euronews: As a soldier, have you ever thought about leaving the Bundeswehr and going to Ukraine? There is the Foreign Legion and many foreign soldiers have also joined Ukrainian units since 2022. David: As an active soldier in the Bundeswehr, fighting for another army is simply not an option for me - I've never really considered it. I do talk to Ukrainian soldiers a lot, though. Just two weeks ago, I was invited to participate in a project with the British Ministry of Defence as a content creator. I had the opportunity to see how Ukrainian recruits are being trained outside of Ukraine as part of Operation Interflex. This is the largest training mission for Ukrainians since 2022, and so far, over 50,000 soldiers have been trained. I had a long conversation with a 25-year-old Ukrainian soldier there about his experiences, whether he was here voluntarily, and how he was coping with the whole situation. He had only received 50 days of training before being sent to the frontline. It was incredibly emotional for me. Just the thought that he could be deployed next week in an emergency, and that he might not make it out alive, was deeply unsettling. As someone who trained as an officer for seven years, it's a stark contrast. This young man, who previously worked as a computer scientist, will be trained as a soldier in just a few weeks, and then expected to fight. How does he feel? And what does that mean for me - as a soldier who has never been to war? Does that make me less valuable as a soldier? And then, of course, it brings me back to what our defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said: the Bundeswehr should be prepared for war so that it never has to go to war. The idea of deterrence. Even if I'm never deployed, my very existence as a soldier contributes to deterrence and, in that sense, perhaps helps prevent war. Euronews: If you were 18 again today, would you decide in favour of the Bundeswehr again in the current security situation? David: I would choose the Bundeswehr again in a heartbeat. Perhaps I would choose a different path in the armed forces today, as I only truly learned about the Bundeswehr once I was already in it. But what really concerns me is the issue of drones. The videos showing drones deliberately targeting young soldiers in Ukraine and exploding at waist height are deeply shocking. As an infantry officer, I would be right there in an emergency - exposed. These images are unsettling. They scare me. If I had the choice again, I'd probably have joined the air force, though. Becoming a pilot, especially in a fighter jet, would have been a very appealing option for me in another life. Euronews: A few weeks ago, you were on ""Hart aber Fair"", a talk show on German TV, where you talked about the issue of compulsory military service. What kind of reactions did you perceive? David: The reactions have been very polarising, with both positive and negative feedback. I've been called all sorts of things, insulted from both sides - labelled a Nazi or a warmonger. I really get all kinds of reactions, from being called a ""Putin boy"" to a warmonger. I take it all in my stride, and to me, it's a sign that if I'm criticised from both sides, I've achieved exactly what I set out to do: speak neutrally and controversially about these topics. It's not my aim to push my own opinion, but to educate people about security policy. We all look the same in uniform, but behind that uniform is a person with their own personality. That was always the exciting thing about the Bundeswehr for me. I come from a small village, grew up in a sheltered environment, went to grammar school, and then joined the Bundeswehr. I met so many different people there - tradespeople, academics, people I'd never encountered before. The Armed Forces showed me how diverse people can be, even when they wear the same uniform."

Within weeks, they were living together in a shoebox apartment in Istanbul.  “The roof was caving in, we were sleeping on the floor, and the streets outside were a sensory overload,” Tyla tells me. “It was like a test. I remember saying to Oscar: if we can make the next month work, we’ll be fine.”  They were better than fine. In fact, a few months later, they were engaged. That’s where things became tricky. She is from Australia, he is from Denmark, and they wanted to have a home base in Bulgaria. Getting married was a convoluted process spanning four countries and two continents.  “We had to go to Denmark to start the process, then I had to visit the Australian embassy in Athens for documents. We had a ceremony in Bulgaria and then had to go to Australia to get my name changed,” Tyla says.  “Only then could we apply for the right residency so we could live and travel together without visa issues.” For digital nomad couples, especially those with different passports, paperwork is par for the course. And that isn’t the only way that a lifestyle on the road affects romance.  Constant travel turns casual dating into an uphill battle. Making the decision to travel together causes relationship milestones to arrive at breakneck speed. And sometimes, spontaneity has to give way to bureaucracy. I know this from personal experience. I met my partner three years ago in a coworking space in Bulgaria. We practically moved in together on day one and have travelled to twenty countries together. It’s wonderful, but also necessary -because there is no country where we are both allowed to stay for more than 90 days at a time.  He’s British, I’m from France, and many of our life decisions are determined by the fact that non-Schengen residents can only spend only 90 days within any 180-day period in the Schengen Area without a visa. It’s not the most romantic setup, but it did force us to commit to the relationship faster than we might have if we lived in one place. “It definitely accelerates things,” Tyla adds. “I remember feeling so connected to Oscar early on, and thinking - should I really feel like this after just a few weeks? But that’s how it goes. You either go all in, or it ends.” Not all nomads are looking for something serious. Many choose this lifestyle because they love the freedom and don’t want to be tied down.  As one member of the r/DigitalNomadssubreddit put it: “Nomad life is about freedom, exploration, pushing your limits. It’s a pretty bad situation for finding a long-term partner.” Even if they do want to build a long-term relationship, finding someone is a challenge. “You shouldn’t expect any serious dating if doing this lifestyle other than the occasional other nomad who may be open to date,” said another Reddit user. “It’s unfair to expect someone local to date you if you’re unwilling to commit to even a single place.” There’s truth to this. Building a romantic relationship when you’ll be leaving in a few weeks is no small feat. If the person is local, they may not want to invest emotionally in someone who’ll soon be gone. If they’re also a nomad, they’re likely on their own journey with other destinations in mind. To help nomads meet people with similar lifestyles - and travel plans -  a few dating apps have popped up in recent years.  Nomads.com lets you list your upcoming destinations so you can see who will be there at the same time. Nomad Soulmates, whose motto is “traveling is better when shared,” promises to “support nomads on their journeys to finding real love.” An easier option - if you’d rather avoid downloading another dating app - is to start your nomad journey with a partner from home. And deciding to do so can actually strengthen a relationship.  Leah and Tamar (names changed to protect anonymity), a couple from Israel, say that becoming nomads brought them closer together.  “The challenges we faced came from living in Israel. Dealing with the cost of living and the security situation,” Leah explains. “Once we were outside of Israel, we actually found a lot more calm and mental peace. Exploring new places together really strengthened our bond.”  They enjoyed several years of nomading across Europe, but things changed when they had a child. “We found ourselves nomading with a baby. Moving from one Airbnb to another across different towns. It was exhausting.”  They eventually settled near Porto, Portugal, in a long-term rental.  “The comfort and routine often seen as the 'enemy' of digital nomadism become incredibly valuable once you have a child,” Leah explains. “It’s no longer easy to give that up, even in the name of adventure.” Still, they’re not giving up on the dream. “Once she turns five, we’d love to return to Asia as a family,” Leah says. I hear the pitter-patter of little (itchy) feet."

But these claims are not always clear or backed up by evidence - and courts are forcing companies to take them down. German non-profit Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) has been on an anti-greenwashing litigation spree over the last three years, stopping more than 100 firms from advertising their products or corporate activities as good for the environment. These include the makers of shower gel and trainers, and cruise and airline operators. Agnes Sauter, head of ecological market surveillance at DUH, says companies are increasingly advertising their products and services with purported environmental benefits as shoppers become more aware of the impacts of the things they buy. But the claims do not always stand up to scrutiny. A 2020 study by the European Commission found more than half of environmental claims in the EU to be vague, misleading or unfounded and 40 per cent were unsubstantiated. “Greenwashing has become a growing problem that misleads consumers and hinders real progress in climate protection and the sustainable use of resources,” says Sauter. Although it has been filing greenwashing claims since May 2022, DUH stepped up its action last year following a judgment by the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) against sweet company Katjes.  The court ruled that ambiguous terms like ‘climate neutral’ - which could mean that a company has actually cut its emissions or that it has bought controversial carbon offsets - would only be allowed if they were properly explained within the advert itself. In the last few months alone, DUH has confronted around 20 companies about their advertising claims under Germany’s Act against Unfair Competition, arguing that information is missing or challenging companies to show that the climate protection projects they use to achieve neutrality can meet their promises.  Sauter says the non-profit sees itself as an advocate for consumers “because correct information about the quality of a product enables informed purchasing decisions to be made”. Judges have proved sympathetic. Last month, sporting goods brand Adidas was ordered to stop advertising that it would become ‘climate neutral by 2050' because it had not clearly explained how it would meet this goal.  “Climate protection is an increasingly important topic for consumers, dominating not only the news but also everyday life,” says Cologne Regional Court. “And advertising a company or its products with supposed climate neutrality can therefore have a significant impact on the purchasing decision.” In a statement, Adidas says the decision relates exclusively to “specific wording” on its website, which has since been changed. Sauter says corporate announcements that companies would be CO2 or climate neutral in the coming decades convey the impression of acting sustainably and responsibly, “but in most cases, this is nothing more than blatant consumer deception”. She says these measures are often formulated vaguely and are difficult or even impossible to verify. “Such advertising claims must be credibly substantiated and presented in a way that is understandable to consumers. In our opinion, anything else is massive greenwashing and must be stopped immediately."" Aviation group Lufthansa, headquartered in Germany, was also banned by Cologne Regional Court in March from advertising that passengers can ‘compensate’ for carbon emissions from its flights. The adverts gave the false impression that a payment would make flying completely carbon neutral.  DUH previously won a similar legal victory specifically against airline Eurowings, which Lufthana operates. Lufthansa says it is carefully considering the latest ruling. Last year, Hamburg Regional Court upheld a greenwashing lawsuit against Shell Germany.  DUH argued that giving customers the option of offsetting emissions from filling their cars with petrol or diesel gave a misleading impression that they could drive without any environmental impacts, because it was done via carbon credits from forest protection projects in Peru and Indonesia. Shell Germany said the decision obliged it to stop CO2 offsetting and to stop selling Shell Helix bottles with the logo ‘CO2-neutral’. Similarly, Karlsruhe Regional Court found consumers had been misled by cruise line TUI Cruises’ advertising promise that its cruise operations would be decarbonised by 2050. Some of DUH’s claims target specific products. Following a successful lawsuit, home improvement chain Obi has been told it cannot advertise a wall paint as ‘climate-neutral’. Some of these cases are still subject to appeal, and DUH will be watching to make sure that any final rulings are followed through. It enforced an injunction it had won in 2023 against drugstore chain dm for misleading consumers with the terms ‘climate neutral’ and ‘environmentally neutral’ on particular products.  When the company started to readvertise with the new slogan ‘act environmentally neutral’, DUH started fresh legal proceedings until dm agreed to stop using that too. A number of DUH’s legal claims are still ongoing and some could be appealed. But Sauter says most of the companies it has legally threatened have withdrawn specific advertising claims and made a declaration that they will stop.  These include gas suppliers who marketed fossil gas as climate-neutral green gas, a company in the Bauhaus Group that advertised a disposable grill made of ‘100% natural materials’ and Poco furniture stores that marketed a chair as ‘environmentally friendly’. Sauter says DUH’s activities were having a “strong signalling effect” and advertising with climate neutrality on the basis of offsetting claims “has rapidly decreased”. And DUH is not done yet. It recently sent cease-and-desist letters to five companies that it claims advertise environmental benefits without providing information about them: beauty Coty over its ‘ocean-friendly’ sunscreen; Deichmann and Tchibo about shoes and clothing marketed as ‘sustainable’; DIY brand Toom over a laminate marketed as ‘good for the environment’; and L'Oreal's over its ‘sustainability commitment’. DUH’s victories only apply directly to corporate activities in Germany. But Sauter points out that competition law is regulated at the EU level and so, if a German court finds an advert to be misleading, there is a good chance that a court in another EU country would agree. Regulators have also been cracking down on greenwashing. The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), for example, previously banned an advert by Lufthansa for making unjustified climate claims. And both the ASA and the Netherlands’ equivalent have ordered Shell and its subsidiaries to take down greenwashed adverts. DUH is now calling on Germany’s new federal government to set clearer rules and fines for consumer deception. It is already required to put into law new EU rules aimed at empowering consumers for the green transition. And in future it will likely have to implement a proposed greenwashing law expected to tackle both product and company-level claims. Sauter says sustainability cannot just be a marketing ploy and must lead to real improvements in the design of products. “After all, honest climate and environmental protection is urgently needed in the face of the climate crisis and can only be strengthened by clear regulations.”"
7d378e95-dd9c-4842-9576-cb159aac2b85,https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/04/12/measles-beef-fat-and-bird-flu-what-europeans-say-about-rfk-jrs-make-america-healthy-again-,04.12.2025 08:00 GMT+1,"Measles, beef fat, and bird flu: What Europeans say about RFK Jr’s Make America Healthy Again agenda","US health chief Robert F Kennedy Jr often points to European standards on his quest to Make America Healthy Again (MAHA). Kennedy has said the United States has “one thousand ingredients in our food that are illegal in Europe” and singled out Belgium’s signature fries in a Fox News segment extolling the benefits of cooking with beef tallow, or rendered beef fat. But Belgium’s friteries aren’t exactly following health guidance when they cook their fries in “blanc de boeuf”. Along with other European countries, Belgium recommends replacing animal fats with olive oil and vegetable oils full of unsaturated fats, including corn, rapeseed, and sunflower oils. “Beef fat is rich in saturated fats which is not good for the cardiovascular health,” Belgium’s public health agency told Euronews Health. Kennedy’s pro-European message is sometimes at odds with his boss, US President Donald Trump, who said last month that American food safety standards are superior to other countries’. RFK Jr may have a point. While the US and European Union both have strict food regulations, the EU tends to take a more cautious approach on things like infant formula and food dyes, which have both been in Kennedy’s crosshairs. On other issues, though, the US health leader doesn’t quite see eye to eye with his European peers. Euronews Health contacted key health agencies from every EU country as well as the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, to ask their scientific opinion on a wide range of issues that Kennedy has raised since his ascent to the top of the US health department. We heard back from 13 of them – Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, and Switzerland – as well as the EU agencies for public health, food safety, and medicines regulation. Here’s where they stand on key planks of the MAHA agenda – including ultra-processed foods, measles vaccines, bird flu, antidepressants, and the link between cell phones and young people’s mental health. RFK Jr’s stance: Kennedy says Americans are being “poisoned” by ultra-processed foods such as sweet cereals and fast food, which often contain high levels of salt, fat, and sugar. Kennedy views them as a key culprit behind the US “epidemic” of chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders. “No other country has anything like this,” Kennedy said in January, referring to the US’s 40 per cent obesity rate. Europe’s take: Obesity rates are lower but rising in Europe. Most countries surveyed agreed that diets high in sugar, salt, and fat are part of the problem – though authorities from Sweden, Belgium, and Norway pointed out that not all processed foods are bad, for example staples like bread or healthy cereals. “A healthy and balanced diet can help prevent these widespread diseases or positively influence their progression,” Germany’s food and agriculture ministry said. Estonia’s social affairs ministry said it was updating its rules around school meals to cut out some ultra-processed foods, while the Czech Republic’s health ministry said it is “actively working” to help bring down their consumption. According to Ireland’s health department, it’s not yet clear whether the health issues linked to ultra-processed foods are due to the processing itself or because these foods tend to be high in calories, saturated fats, salt, or added sugars. The country is working on a new policy to tackle obesity next year, with restrictions on unhealthy food marketing and incentives for healthier eating on the table. RFK Jr’s stance: Kennedy has called out added sugars in infant formula and artificial food dyes in the US. One of his key targets is tartrazine, a synthetic yellow dye known as Yellow 5. Europe’s take: In the EU, tartrazine can be used in only a handful of foods, such as processed cheese and canned vegetables.  It is also one of six food colourings that the UK’s food safety agency says may cause “increased hyperactivity in some children”. Foods containing those dyes must come with a warning label in the UK. When it comes to baby formulas, EU rules favour lactose, a naturally occurring sugar found in breast milk, over corn syrup and other added sugars commonly found in US formulas. The US allows several other food additives that Europeans won’t find on their supermarket shelves, partly due to a rule that has allowed manufacturers to introduce new food chemicals without clearance from regulators. That’s what Kennedy wants to change, complaining in January that compared to Europe, the US “looks at any new chemical as innocent until proven guilty”. RFK Jr’s stance: Amid a major measles outbreak that has killed three people in the US this year, Kennedy said this week that the measles vaccine is the “most effective way” to prevent infections. But the endorsement came weeks after he hailed vitamin A as an effective treatment against measles and cast doubt on the safety of vaccines. “I would compare [the outbreak] to what’s happening in Europe now,” Kennedy told journalists this week, referencing an uptick in measles in parts of Europe and Central Asia and describing the US response as a “model for the rest of the world”. Europe’s take: Several countries pointed to World Health Organization (WHO) guidance that says vitamin A can help certain measles patients, but noted that because vitamin A deficiency is rare in Europe, it may not apply to infected kids there. The surveyed countries universally recommend that children get the measles vaccine, with Luxembourg’s ministry of health and social security saying “vitamin A can never replace the need for vaccination”. Switzerland’s authorities added that parents should “understand the risks for their children when they leave them unvaccinated and thus unprotected from a sometimes deadly disease with no real treatments available”. But childhood vaccination rates have fallen in several European countries in recent years, and “restoring confidence in the safety and effectiveness of vaccination” is critical, Slovakia’s public health authority said. RFK Jr’s stance: Avian influenza is spreading in US dairy cattle and wild birds, and experts fear it could pose a threat to human health. Kennedy said that instead of culling birds when they are infected, farmers should consider letting the virus “run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds that are immune to it”. Europe’s take: Asked whether this approach might be on the table in the EU, a spokesperson for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said it “has never made such a recommendation”. Bird flu is on the list of diseases that would have a “large impact” on animal and human health if left uncontrolled, the EFSA spokesperson noted. EU law mandates that infected animals are quickly culled. None of the national agencies contacted by Euronews Health said it would be a good idea to allow the virus to spread among infected animals either.  According to Estonia’s social affairs ministry, the idea is “not practical or ethical”. Meanwhile, Switzerland’s agencies warned that authorities should move quickly to stamp out infections because “the more the bird flu virus is able to circulate freely, the greater the likelihood that it will mutate and adapt to other species or to humans”. RFK Jr’s stance: In February, Trump ordered Kennedy to investigate the “threat” posed by several medicines, including the class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, stimulants, and anti-obesity drugs. Kennedy has suggested that antidepressants are as hard to quit as heroin. Europe’s take: European countries said they are generally not worried about medicines that have been approved, including those on Kennedy’s list, though they stressed the importance of regular safety monitoring.  But a few countries raised specific concerns. The Czech health ministry, for example, warned against the “overuse of these medications, especially in those who do not need them,” while Luxembourg’s health and social security ministry said it does extra surveillance to identify the misuse of weight loss drugs and psychostimulants. In Finland, officials said anti-obesity medicines should only be available for people who have tried to lose weight through diet and exercise and whose health is at risk from obesity. Estonia’s authorities, meanwhile, are worried about the use of psychostimulants – particularly the attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication methylphenidate, commonly known as Ritalin. Belgium was the most concerned. The public health agency there said many people take antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and other mental health drugs over a long period of time without being properly assessed or monitored, which is “alarming” and “clearly a public health issue”. RFK Jr’s stance: Kennedy supports calls to ban mobile phones in schools, citing their impact on children’s mental health and raising concerns that phones “produce electromagnetic radiation” that can cause cancer. Europe’s take: Several countries are also worried about teens’ mobile phone use and mental health. The Czech health ministry pointed to anxiety, poor sleep, and less socialisation as consequences of too much screen time, while Slovenian officials said poor mental health is a “growing problem” tied to the devices. Norway’s government was more nuanced, saying it’s difficult to disentangle how phones, digital media, and other social trends are affecting young people. Notably, most countries said they had no evidence to support the idea that cell phones increase cancer risks.  A few pointed to a WHO conclusion that exposure to radio waves from mobile phones over a long period of time is “possibly carcinogenic to humans” – though they all stressed that the findings are far from conclusive. “Although many studies have since been conducted, there are still no results that collectively confirm or deny a carcinogenic effect,” Denmark’s health authority said.

Confidence in management, in markets and in the rational making of policy. The extreme volatility of the past week underscores the crisis in confidence on European investors, but the recent turbulence also presents opportunities. Short-term fluctuations may unsettle investors who are used to predictability, but they also present entry points in undervalued sectors. In general terms, for the last decade, there has been a shift towards trading US-listed stocks, while UK and European valuations have suffered accordingly. However, a renewed focus on domestic markets is a growing trend amongst investors as they grapple with the unpredictability of the US markets. Much has been written about the rise of European defence stocks – BAE Systems, Thales, Rheinmetall – but defensive sectors are also in the spotlight. Healthcare companies such as weight-loss titans Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca and Roche present stable earnings and a lower sensitivity to economic cycles. Nestle, Unilever and L’Oreal offer consistent cash flows and some cushioning from volatility. Uncertainty still reigns in some sectors, with nervousness that tariffs on Chinese production will lead to dumping of goods in Europe. While Chinese EVs are all but excluded from the US market, providing opportunities for VW, BMW and Stellantis, it is likely that BYD and Nio will have to find alternative markets. While stock picking is important, market volatility has led to increased cash holdings, as investors grow more risk-averse, express lower confidence in equities, and position themselves opportunistically to buy the dip. Money market funds are likely to benefit alongside bank deposits. So, what should investors do? Holding assets in cash is a great short-term insurance policy but a poor long-term investment. A gradual drip feed of investment into a diverse range of quality companies could be a smart approach. Choosing collective investments over single stocks and balancing higher-risk investments with more mundane choices may help smooth out the bumps along the way.

At this stage, it just depends on who you ask. The return of Donald Trump to the White House has unleashed seismic changes across the globe, forcing nations to re-evaluate their alliances and rivalries in desperate search of shelter against the president's go-for-broke policies. His sweeping tariffs, in particular, have deeply unsettled governments, which are now seriously contemplating if the trade flows and supply chains on which they have relied for the past decades are about to crumble overnight, wreaking untold havoc. For the European Union, an export-oriented powerhouse and staunch advocate of free markets, the Trump tariffs have hit like a slap in the face. Despite the White House's surprise reversal, the bloc will still be subject to the 10% baseline rate. Additionally, steel, aluminum and cars will be under a punishing 25% levy. Trump has threatened further duties on foreign-made pharmaceuticals, a precious sector for the Europeans. With transatlantic relations plunging at a vertiginous pace and the American market becoming increasingly prohibitive, Brussels is on the hunt for economic opportunities that can offset, even if partially, the shockwaves unleashed by Trump. China has quickly emerged as a prospective option. Thanks to a vast middle class that is increasingly wealthier and, therefore, increasingly able to afford foreign-made goods, China represents a lucrative business partner that can provide European companies with new clients and fresh investment – exactly what they need at a time of stagnant growth at home and political turmoil abroad. In 2023, the US was the top destination for EU-made goods (€501.9 billion) followed by China (€223.5 billion), according to Eurostat. However, China brought the largest share of goods into the bloc (€516.2 billion) after the US (€346.7 billion). It was telling that a few days after Trump showed up at the Rose Garden and unveiled his self-styled ""reciprocal tariffs"", Ursula von der Leyen held a phone call with Chinese Premier Li Qiang to discuss bilateral issues and the state of the global economy. ""In response to the widespread disruption caused by the US tariffs, President von der Leyen stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of the world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field,"" the European Commission said in its official read-out. The version released by Beijing was notably more optimistic and highlighted a ""momentum of steady growth"" in ties. ""China is ready to work with the European side to promote the sound and steady development of China-EU relations,"" Li told von der Leyen. The exchange, peppered with explicit criticism of Trump's policies (Li called them ""economic bullying""), immediately fuelled speculation that the leaders were carefully planting the seeds for a rapprochement. Von der Leyen, who during her first mandate spearheaded a new policy to de-risk from China, has in recent months softened her tone. Now, the Commission chief prefers to speak about a ""transactional"" foreign policy to ""engage constructively"" with Beijing. The impression of a diplomatic thaw deepened a few days later when Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez flew to Beijing and met with President Xi Jinping. Sánchez described China as an ""essential partner"" in tackling modern-day challenges and made a plea to turn the page on the confrontational approach. ""Spain is in favour of more balanced relations between the European Union and China, of finding negotiated solutions to our differences, which we have, and of greater cooperation in areas of common interest,"" Sánchez declared. Then, on Friday, the Commission delivered more news: Brussels and Beijing have agreed to take a second look at the option of ""price undertakings"" (minimum prices) to resolve the long-running dispute on China-made electric vehicles. The option was repeatedly floated last year but quietly abandoned due to a lack of progress. Diplomats from member states, which have been traditionally split on how to deal with China, have taken note of the developments, without rushing to issue a verdict. ""The EU wants and needs to be seen as a reliable partner in the world,"" a diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""In that sense, the discussion with China is evolving because China is looking at us differently. I don't think the European approach towards China has changed completely, but the winds are moving."" The geopolitical winds might be moving – but not all blow in China's favour. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced his army had captured two Chinese citizens fighting alongside Russia inside Ukrainian territory. He later said his government had collected ""precise data"" indicating that more than 150 Chinese nationals had joined the war on Moscow's side. Ukraine's security services say the Chinese citizens were recruited by Russia through advertisements, including on social media, but have been unable to verify whether the central government in Beijing was aware or involved in the operation. ""I think the United States of America should pay attention to what is happening today. And we expect after this, that this is another country that militarily supports Russia's invasion of Ukraine – on the side of Russia. This is another one after Iran and the North Korean military,"" Zelenskyy said. The Chinese Foreign Ministry struck back, saying the claims had ""no basis in fact"". ""Let me stress that the Chinese government always asks Chinese nationals to stay away from areas of armed conflict,"" said Lin Jian, the ministry's spokesperson. In Brussels, the news arrived just a few hours after von der Leyen spoke with Premier Li, almost like a reality check that dampened the fervor of a potential rapprochement. For the past three years, the EU has been dismayed by Beijing's hands-off position on the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which it consistently refers to as a ""crisis"", and by the ""no limits"" partnership established between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. (Xi is expected to attend the 9 May celebrations in Moscow at Putin's invitation. By contrast, he has refused to travel to Belgium for the EU-China summit in July.) High Representative Kaja Kallas left no doubt of her frustration. ""What is clear is that China is the key enabler of Russia's war. Without Chinese support, Russia wouldn't be able to wage the war in the amount that they are waging it. We see that 80% of the dual-use goods are actually entering Russia via China,"" Kallas said, referring to the circumvention of Western sanctions. ""If China would want to really stop the support then it would have an impact."" Beijing's close-knit friendship with Moscow has added to a string of grievances and tensions that have plunged EU-China relations to an all-time low. Other tensions involve the massive export of low-cost, made-in-China products, the heavy use of state subsidies to the detriment of foreign competitors, protectionist regulations that prevent European access to the Chinese market, surveillance of private citizens and companies, the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, aggressive behavior in the Taiwan Strait, the repression of the Uyghur minority in the Xinjiang region, violations of human rights, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns. Any coordination between Brussels and Beijing to navigate the Trump tariffs is highly unlikely to deliver a resolution on this long – and unrelated – range of open fronts, all of which are complex and depend on factors that go well beyond the EU's control. Although some leaders like Spain's Pedro Sánchez and Hungary's Viktor Orbán advocate for a reset in relations, others remain profoundly skeptical. The coalition deal of the next German government, led by Friedrich Merz, reads: ""We must recognise that the elements of systemic rivalry have now come to the fore as a result of China's actions."" The contradictions in public discourse – calls for closer cooperation next to stinging criticism – encapsulate the persistent difficulty in finding a common, uniform line of action on China among the 27 member states. The ambivalence has remained even as Beijing stood by the same country the bloc considers its main adversary – Russia – and is set to go on as the EU searches for new partners to face up to Trump's disruption. Whether those partnerships are forged on genuine shared values or opportunistic pragmatism is an entirely separate matter. ""Current trade talks with China are not necessarily about working closer with Beijing: they are rather about using this strategic moment of uncertainty to negotiate new conditions and a new framework for engagement with China,"" said Alicja Bachulska, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). ""It is not a return to 'business as usual'. The EU would like to get some concessions from Beijing, such as enforceable rules on tech transfer from China or local content requirements, trying to ensure more value-added for the European economy. It remains unclear whether Beijing would be willing to do that."""

The panel react to the recent court case that found French National Rally leader Marine Le Pen guilty of embezzling millions of euros of EU funds and banned her potentially from running for political office for five years. The news has triggered a lively debate across France, as Le Pen was tipped to be a frontrunner in the upcoming 2027 presidential elections. Fabrice Leggeri, a close friend of Marine Le Pen, insisted she was innocent. ""It's not a surprise that French judges want to bar Marine Le Pen from the presidential election"", he told the panel. But Cynthia Ní Mhurchú - a barrister by trade - said being in denial was an example of the far right undermining institutions and independent judges. ""This is all about democracy. This is about Marine Le Pen undermining democracy, and not only seeking to undermine, but deliberately undermining democracy and the rule of law and all of those values that I know my group hold dearly"". The panel also discussed the roller coaster ride that the world just had due to President Donald Trump's tariff announcement. The uncertainty has given the EU a shake up to seek other partners and allies across the world. ""It's a good kick up the backside because actually it's great that Ursula von der Leyen stood there and said, ""we will work with anybody who has a mutual interest"", Dharmendra Kanani said, adding ""I would say to her to put ""p.s. that share our values"", please..

In fact, more than half (57%) of teachers who wish to buy a home do not think this will be achievable on a teachers’ salary. So, how realistic is it for European teachers to buy a house? Euronews compared teacher salaries and house prices across Europe, and calculated how many months' salary a teacher would need to buy a house or flat as in 2023.  This estimate is based on statutory salaries for lower secondary teachers and does not account for mortgage interest rates. The full methodology is explained at the end of the article. Among 24 European countries, Ireland is the most affordable for teachers looking to buy a home. A 100-square metre property costs the equivalent of 106 times a lower secondary teacher’s statutory salary.  In addition to Ireland, teachers in a few other countries can afford a home with 10 years’ worth of salary—meaning 120 months or less. They included Spain (112 months), the Netherlands (114 months) and Belgium (Flemish Comm, 120 months).  Denmark closely follows these most affordable countries at 126 months.  The cost of a 100 m² house is equivalent to less than 15 years' salary for teachers in Luxembourg (145 months), Germany (157), Portugal (162), and England (175). This figure ranges between 15 and 20 years in nine out of the 24 countries included in the list. In Italy, a teacher would need 191 months’ salary to buy a 100 m² house, followed by Norway with 192 months and Austria with 203 months.  In France, this figure rises to 230 months. The least affordable country for teachers to buy a house is Hungary, where they would need over 35 years’ salary—equivalent to 443 months—to afford a 100 m² home.  This time also exceeds 30 years in Slovakia (398 months) and Czechia (383 months). By looking at the equivalent number of monthly salaries needed for a teacher to buy a 100 m² home along with teacher salaries and property prices two trends emerge across Europe: For example, in the Netherlands, a 100 m² home costs €495,411, while the average gross monthly salary is €6,425. This makes the Netherlands the third most affordable country for teachers to buy a home.  In contrast, Hungary has the fifth most affordable house prices at €284,637. However, it is the least affordable country for teachers, as the average gross monthly salary is only €967. “For young teachers starting out, especially in the South East and in London, home ownership will be unrealistic unless supported with a large deposit by parents,” Andrew Lifford, Casework and Subscriptions Manager at EDAPT, told Euronews.  “Take home pay for teachers after taxes and pension contributions will be £1,800 - £2,800 (€2,155-€3,350) each month. Which if privately renting will mean that it will take many years for teachers to save towards a deposit to place down on a house.” Based on OECD data, the net monthly salary for teachers in England used in our calculations is €2,553. The EU's Education and Training Monitor 2023 report also revealed that at least 24 EU countries are facing teacher shortages, often driven by low wages and heavy workloads.  In recent years, teacher pay isn’t keeping up with the cost of living in many European countries when adjusted for inflation. According to the OECD, the real statutory salaries of lower secondary teachers fell in 10 out of 22 countries between 2015 and 2023. NASUWT’s survey also revealed that four in ten teachers (42%) said housing costs have influenced where they have applied for a teaching post. Almost three quarters (72%) don’t believe there is sufficient affordable housing for teachers where they live.  To make teacher salaries comparable across countries, we used the OECD’s most recent data from 2023. Net monthly salaries were calculated using local “net salary calculator” websites in each country. For property prices, we followed a similar approach to BestBrokers.com’s report on income and housing affordability, using Numbeo data. We calculated the average price per square metre based on apartment sale prices both in and outside the city centres.  Mortgage interest rates, marital status, and other personal factors were not included in the calculation. The estimate simply reflects how many months of a teacher’s salary would be needed to buy a home. Naturally, this number can vary widely within each country depending on location and individual circumstances."

There were no immediate reports of injuries. Greg Almaguer, a tourist from Texas, recalled how he had been eating dinner with his family when the explosion occurred. ""I just heard the explosion and started smelling the powder,"" he said. ""Right away, I could tell there was just a big explosion, powerful and scary."" The explosion comes amid widespread public anger over a 2023 railway disaster, Greece’s worst, in which 57 people were killed and dozens more injured when a freight train and a passenger train heading in opposite directions were accidentally put on the same track. Local media said a newspaper and a news website had received an anonymous call shortly before Friday evening's blast, with the caller warning that a bomb had been planted outside the railway company offices and would explode within about 40 minutes. In a statement, Hellenic Train said the explosion had occurred “very close to its central offices” and said the blast had caused limited damage and no injuries to any employees or passers-by. It said authorities had acted immediately upon receiving information about the warning call, and that the company was cooperating fully with authorities and ensuring the safety of its staff. Police cordoned off the site along a major avenue in the Greek capital, keeping residents and tourists away from the building in an area with several bars and restaurants. Officers at the scene said a bag containing an explosive device had been placed near the Hellenic Train building on Syngrou Avenue. Police forensics experts wearing white coveralls were collecting evidence at the scene. Criticism over the government’s handling of the Feb. 28, 2023 collision at Tempe in northern Greece has mounted over the last few weeks in the wake of the second anniversary of the disaster, which killed mostly young people who had been returning to university classes after a public holiday. The crash exposed severe deficiencies in Greece’s railway system, including in safety systems, and has triggered mass protests - led by relatives of the victims - against the country’s conservative government. Critics accused authorities of failing to take political responsibility for the disaster or holding senior officials accountable. So far, only rail officials have been charged with any crimes. Several protests in recent weeks have turned violent, with demonstrators clashing with police."

Erdoğan also said Turkey is able to span geopolitical divisions over Ukraine, Syria and the recent wave of US tariffs that have sparked a global trade war. The Turkish president, speaking at the annual Antalya Diplomacy Forum, is facing disruption at home from protests against the imprisonment of his main political rival, Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. ""It has become clear once again that European security is unthinkable without Turkey. Turkey is ready to take responsibility for European security in the future as well,"" he said at the opening of the three-day gathering. As trans-Atlantic relations cool under the Trump administration, NATO member Turkey, which has the alliance’s second-largest military and a well-developed defence industry, is seeking a broader role. The White House has warned that the continent must look after its own security, including Ukraine, and has so far shown no willingness to back a largely European force in Ukraine in the face of Russian hostility. Turkey has emerged as a key broker in the Black Sea region, preserving relations with both Ukraine and Russia. Erdoğan and Trump have both spoken of their close personal relationship. ""I believe that our relations with the United States will flourish in every field during President Trump's second term, also with the contribution of our close friendship with him,"" the Turkish president told an audience of world leaders and diplomats. Turning to Trump's tariffs, Erdoğan held out the chance of a positive outcome for Turkey, which has been placed within the baseline 10% tariff. ""We are doing our best to prevent the heated commercial competition over customs tariffs from becoming destructive,"" Erdoğan said. ""Turkey will be one of the winners of this process."" Turkey is also an influential actor in neighbouring Syria as rebel groups it supported during the civil war took power last December. However, the fall of long-time president Bashar Al-Assad has aggravated already tense relations between Turkey and Israel, with their conflicting interests pushing the relationship toward a possible collision course. When Trump hosted Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington last month, he advised him to be ""reasonable"" in his dealings with Ankara. Erdoğan told the forum in Antalya: ""We are in a state of understanding and close dialogue with influential actors in the region, especially Trump and Putin, in preserving the territorial integrity of Syria."" Syria's new President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, sat just two places away from Erdoğan. In an apparent warning, Erdoğan said that ""no-one should misunderstand our cool-headedness and our stance of resolving issues through dialogue."" The president, a vocal critic of Israel's military operations in Gaza, also focused on the killing of civilians in the enclave. ""Even if it is at war, does a legitimate state act like this? Isn't this called state terrorism? That's why Israel is a terrorist state,"" Erdoğan claimed."

Czech Agriculture Minister Marek Výborný said the restrictions could be lifted 30 days after culling the last farm animal infected with foot-and-mouth disease in Slovakia. ""The most significant risk is due to transmission through contaminated human objects,"" said Jiri Cerny, an associate professor at the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. ""That means on tires and cars, on the soles of shoes, through contaminated food."" Slovakia declared a state of emergency at the end of March to rid the country of foot-and-mouth disease after three cases were discovered in separate farms. On Monday, the Slovakian government said it had also reintroduced temporary border checks with Hungary and Austria in response to the escalating outbreak.  The measure, which came into effect on Tuesday, will remain in place until 8 May, according to Interior Minister Matúš Šutaj Eštok. ""Although the presence of foot-and-mouth disease has not been confirmed in Austria, the measure is necessary due to the proximity of outbreak areas,"" he said. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a highly contagious viral disease of livestock, mainly affects cattle but can also infect swine, sheep and goats. The virus is preserved in saliva, urine, faeces and milk. It is transmitted by contact with sick animals, through the air, and on the surfaces of people, tools or vehicles. But the risk of transmission to humans is very low to negligible."

Ekrem İmamoğlu has been held at Silviri Prison west of Istanbul since his formal arrest on corruption charges on 23 March. The current court case alleges that he threatened a public prosecutor, and is one of six that predate his arrest last month, sparking nationwide protests. Addressing the judge, İmamoğlu said he was in court because he had won three elections against the person ""who thinks he owns Istanbul,"" a reference to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who launched his political career as the city's mayor in the 1990s. Erdoğan was heavily involved in backing his party's candidates against İmamoğlu. The hearing was attended by İmamoğlu's wife and son, as well as lawmakers from the Republican People's Party (CHP), Halk TV and other media outlets. The case was adjourned until 16 June. The mayor, who is also the main opposition challenger to Erdoğan's 22-year rule at the next presidential election, faces more than seven years in prison and a political ban for allegedly ""targeting, threatening and insulting persons working in the fight against terrorism."" The charge stems from comments he made on 20 January in which he criticised Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor Akın Gürlek over criminal cases brought against other opposition figures. İmamoğlu was initially detained on 19 March in relation to two investigations, one focusing on corruption in the Istanbul municipality and another alleging terrorism links in his party's electoral pact with pro-Kurdish politicians. Demonstrations calling for his release and an end to Turkey's democratic backsliding under Erdoğan have led to the arrest of around 2,000 people for attending rallies banned by city authorities. The mayor was officially nominated as the CHP presidential candidate while in custody. An election is due to be held in 2028 but may come sooner and İmamoğlu's imprisonment has been widely viewed as politically motivated despite Turkey's government insisting the judiciary is independent and free from political influence. Also on Friday, two other courts in Istanbul were also holding hearings on cases against İmamoğlu. One is a bid-rigging case that dates back 10 years, when he was mayor of Istanbul's Beylikdüzü district. The other alleges illegal donation collection and stems from a video circulated in the run-up to last year’s local elections showing CHP staff counting bundles of cash."

Witkoff, who has been pressing the Kremlin to accept a truce, initially met with Putin's envoy, Kirill Dmitriev. The meeting comes amid growing questions about Putin's willingness to stop the more than three-year war. Earlier on Friday, US President Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that ""Russia has to get moving"" towards ending the war, adding that it is ""terrible and senseless."" Ukraine has endorsed a US ceasefire proposal, but Russia has effectively blocked it by imposing far-reaching conditions. European governments have accused Putin of dragging his feet. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said ahead of the talks that ""breakthroughs are not expected,"" adding that ""the process of normalisation of relations is ongoing."" ""Russia continues to use bilateral talks with the United States to delay negotiations about the war in Ukraine, suggesting that the Kremlin remains uninterested in serious peace negotiations to end the war,"" the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said in an assessment late on Thursday. Washington remains committed to securing a peace deal, even though four weeks have passed since it made its ceasefire proposals, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said. ""It is a dynamic that will not be solved militarily. It is a meat grinder,"" Bruce said, adding that ""nothing else can be discussed…until the shooting and the killing stops."""

The battle for the city, a key logistical hub in the Donbas region, has been ongoing for over nine months. Azhur, a battalion commander with Ukraine's 117th Brigade, said, ""Are we holding them? We are. Are we pushing them? We are pushing. Are we advancing? We are."" ""We are not retreating now. At this moment, we have momentum."" Pokrovsk, situated northwest of the city of Donetsk, has become a focal point in Ukraine's efforts to slow the Russian advance and maintain control over vital supply routes. At the end of March, a mandatory evacuation of families with children was announced in the frontline village of Bilytske and its surrounding area of the Donetsk region. According to local police, officers and representatives of the military administration have been speaking with parents, urging them to evacuate. In cases where families refuse to leave, Ukraine's ""guardianship authorities"" have the legal right to temporarily remove children from their families. According to Valerii Shakhrai, inspector of the juvenile prevention department, this measure is a last resort that is rarely used. ""The guardianship authorities have the authority to temporarily remove children from families that refuse forced evacuation, without depriving them of parental rights,"" he said. ""Foster families. Then the parents can leave the dangerous area and pick up the child, but we use this very rarely."" Elsewhere in the country, Ukraine's Air Force reported a wave of Russian drone attacks overnight from Thursday into Friday. A total of 39 drones were launched, with air defence units managing to shoot down 24 of them. The drones targeted multiple regions, including Dnipro, Donetsk, and Zhytomyr,"" Shakhrai said. Meanwhile, in a daily briefing, the Russian Defence Ministry claimed on Thursday to have gained control over the village of Zhuravka in Ukraine's northern Sumy region."

The vessel, named the Kiwala, had been reportedly operating under the flag of Djibouti. However, it was caught not flying a flag, which is a violation of maritime law. Although the crew provided a flag certificate, the Djibouti naval authority said it could not find the Kiwala in its national registry. ""Ships like this are actually not allowed to operate. Estonia exercised its right to detain the vessel for inspection,"" Deputy Director General of the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) Veiko Kommusaar said. The Kiwala has been sanctioned by the EU, Kommusaar said. Additionally, the vessels has been under further sanctions by Canada, Switzerland and the UK, according to reports. It was en route to the Russian port of Ust-Luga. As part of Moscow's ""shadow fleet,"" it is suspected of transporting Russian oil in order to circumvent sanctions. The Kiwala will now remain under guard by three navy vessels until further checks are completed. ""It is no secret that over the past year, a number of vessels have appeared in the Gulf of Finland that sail without proper documentation,"" Kommusaar explained. ""And it can be stated quite clearly that it is part of the shadow fleet, which uses the Baltic Sea to transport goods, which is prohibited."" The vessel's owner is Tirad Shipping, a Mauritius-based company that operates only one ship — the Kiwala."

""I think that it's good that it has been now taken over, that we are meeting on a regular basis. The United States is still participating,"" he said. “I think it's very important that we all decided to continue the UDCG, the Ramstein Group, a corporation of more than 50 countries to support Ukraine.""  The UDCG, also known as the Ramstein group, is an alliance of 57 countries (all 32 member states of NATO and 25 other countries) and the European Union, providing military equipment to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion.  It’s a role once exclusively held by the United States under former defence secretary Lloyd Austin but successor Pete Hegseth has never chaired it.  Since then, the UK and Germany have stepped into the breach, but it hadn’t been clear whether this was a temporary measure until now.   Western sources initially said the UK and German joint-chair was a stopgap while the Trump administration and new team became fully acquainted with the file.  The US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth attended online today.  The move comes amid a series of other signals by the Trump administration that the US role in NATO is diminishing.  Western allies are also bracing themselves for the potential withdrawal of thousands of troops from Europe. Currently, the US has 100,000 troops stationed across mainly central Europe.   Brekelmans says if such an announcement is forthcoming that he hoped the US would do so as part of a negotiated process, keeping allies abreast of the plans.  ""If the United States, over time, decides to reallocate some of its resources to their own region—for homeland defence—or to the Indo-Pacific or anywhere else, I think the most important thing is that we do this together,” he said.  “We need a shared plan where they can shift some resources, and we, as European countries, can gradually take over.”  “But we need to keep the United States on board. They will remain essential to our security. It’s also in the interest of the United States to keep NATO strong — and that’s what they always state,"" Brekelmans concluded. The US NATO delegation has been contacted for comment."

The situation, which has steadily deteriorated since the dissolution of the Cambodia National Rescue Party in 2017, now demands close international attention to help restore democratic governance and protect human rights. As the United States veers towards increasingly isolationist policies, it is time for Europe to step up and fill this void. Over the past several years, hundreds of activists and human rights defenders have been imprisoned, opposition and civil society leaders have been forced into exile, international NGOs have been pushed out of the country, and independent media outlets have been silenced. The 2023 elections, organised without recognized opposition and widely condemned as sham exercises in legitimacy, have only deepened the nation’s slide into a hereditary dictatorship, replacing the long-ruling former Khmer Rouge senior commander Hun Sen with his son, Hun Manet. These actions have not only dismantled Cambodia’s democratic institutions but also emboldened the regime in Phnom Penh to pursue its critics at home and abroad — as tragically exemplified by the assassination of former CNRP lawmaker Lim Kimya in Bangkok earlier this year. The decision by the Trump administration to freeze USAID has left a gaping hole in many programmes in Southeast Asia, including Cambodia’s demining efforts. Coupled with the ongoing tariff war between the US and China, the US is steadily retreating, leaving the region open to China’s influence. This could ultimately mean less scrutiny of cases of democratic backsliding, human rights abuses, and transnational repression by burgeoning autocracies. The European Union — long a beacon of democratic values and human rights — has an opportunity to step forward with concrete measures to counter this alarming trend and defend Cambodia’s fledgling democracy. A recent resolution by the European Parliament, which calls for a review of Cambodia’s tariff privileges under the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme and sanctions against key figures in the regime, is an important first step. But there is still more to do. In 2020, the EU made the commitment that “should there be no significant improvements, the EU stands ready to initiate the procedure for the temporary withdrawal of the remaining tariff preferences” for Cambodia. The situation has only worsened since. The Commission must uphold its pledge from 2020 by fully suspending the EBA trade scheme for Cambodia. By suspending these privileges, the EU can send a clear message: economic cooperation is contingent upon respect for human rights and democratic governance. This measure would underscore the principle that improving human rights and safeguarding civil society freedoms remain the basis for economic cooperation, trade and investment. Targeted visa sanctions and asset freezes are also tools in the EU’s arsenal. In 2021, the EU imposed targeted sanctions on four Russian individuals for human rights abuses. They were accused of arbitrary arrests and detentions of opposition members, including Alexei Navalny and peaceful protesters, and the systematic repression of rights. As similar tactics of arrest, exile, and intimidation are used by the elites within Cambodia, it is clear that those responsible for orchestrating Cambodia’s systematic erosion of democratic norms can, and must, be held accountable. Imposing such sanctions under the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime would not only deter further abuses but also prevent the laundering of ill-gotten gains through international financial channels. Equally concerning is the plight of courageous individuals like environmental defenders Leng Ouch, Sovadhanak Hun, Heng Sros and Choub Sreynuth. Forced into exile in Thailand after exposing illegal logging and corruption, these activists now face the real danger of repatriation and subsequent persecution. Their safety is non-negotiable. The EU must work to provide these defenders with asylum and ensure that they are resettled in countries where they can continue their vital work free from persecution. I have formally communicated these concerns and policy proposals in a letter to High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Kaja Kallas, who I hope to meet soon alongside representatives of the European Commission, Council and the Parliament. I underscored the urgent need for the EU to take decisive action against the Cambodian regime’s authoritarian practices. Such a dialogue is crucial for developing a coordinated and robust response to Cambodia’s democratic backsliding. The gravity of Cambodia’s regression into authoritarianism, compounded by its deepening strategic and economic ties with Beijing, demands a robust and coordinated international response. In the absence of a strong US presence in the region, the EU must step up and fill the void, leading the way in confronting the repressive measures of the Hun regime. Europe has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to defending democracy in the face of authoritarian aggression. Cambodia’s current trajectory is not an isolated case — it is a stark reminder that inaction only emboldens repressive regimes. The EU now faces a historic opportunity to lead by example, to stand firmly for democratic values, and to protect the rights and freedoms that are under assault in Cambodia. The world is watching, and history will judge our response. Let us ensure that the EU’s actions reaffirm our collective commitment to a future where democracy and human rights are not only preserved but are allowed to flourish. Mu Sochua, a former Cambodian politician and Nobel Peace Prize nominee, is president of the Khmer Movement for Democracy (KMD)."

From online shopping to searching the web, AI is evolving into a useful, time-saving tool for people and corporations alike. When it comes to climate change, AI is proving its usefulness there, too. At the UK’s Cambridge University, researchers are using AI in everything from climate modelling to land use planning, and see it as a transformative tool for protecting nature. Researchers at Oxford University have created an AI tool that promises to make corporations' environmental conduct more transparent. Even Google has touted the benefits, developing various AI-powered tools to improve climate resilience. Despite all the potential for AI to have a positive impact on the climate crisis, there are concerns over its potentially significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.  A new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that AI is driving a massive increase in electricity demand. Data centres, which form the backbone of AI systems, are projected to double their energy demand in the next five years. IEA projects that, by 2030, data centre electricity demand will rise to around 945 terawatt hours - that’s more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan. However, the report also points out that AI has the potential to cut emissions elsewhere. It says that if it is adopted in the right ways, the carbon savings it accounts for could offset the additional emissions it generates. AI is one of the biggest stories in the energy world today,” says IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “But until now, policy makers and markets lacked the tools to fully understand the wide-ranging impacts.”  AI requires large amounts of energy to train and run. The huge processing power required to support large language models comes from thousands of servers housed in data centres, some of which consume as much energy as a small country. Data centres are located all over the world, although the US leads with 5,381 facilities, around 40 per cent of the global market. Other countries with significant data centres include the UK, Germany, India, Australia, France and the Netherlands. The power consumption of these facilities is substantial. Some AI-focused data centres use as much electricity as two million households. In 2023, they accounted for around 1.5 per cent of the total global electricity consumption, but are set to consume a lot more in the coming years. Training AI requires a great deal of processor power, and therefore a lot of electricity. Research published in the Journal of Machine Learning found that training the popular OpenAI ChatGPT model consumed 1,287 megawatt hours of electricity, producing as much CO2 as 80 short-haul flights in Europe. “What is different about generative AI is the power density it requires, "" says Noman Bashir, Computing and Climate Impact Fellow at MIT. “Fundamentally, it is just computing, but a generative AI training cluster might consume seven or eight times more energy than a typical computing workload.” Running the software is less energy-intensive per task, but it quickly begins to add up when millions of queries are being submitted every day.  The Electric Power Research Institute found that, per query, ChatGPT consumes approximately 2.9 watt-hours. That’s around ten times the amount of energy required for a standard Google search. As of early 2025, ChatGPT is processing more than a billion queries per day, and the number is growing.  In early 2025, around 8 per cent of US adults were using ChatGPT as their primary search engine. That’s still a fraction of the number who use Google, but given it has grown from just 1 per cent in June 2024, this underscores the rapid shift towards AI-powered tools. There’s also the changing face of AI to consider. Current queries are usually limited to text-based interactions. Emerging AI video, image and audio applications have no precedent, but are likely to be even more thirsty for fuel. “When we think about the environmental impact of generative AI, it is not just the electricity you consume when you plug the computer in,” says Elsa A. Olivetti, professor in the Department of Materials Science at MIT. “There are much broader consequences that go out to a system level and persist based on actions that we take.” According to the IEA, concerns that AI could accelerate climate change are ‘overstated.’ It says that, despite the growth, emissions caused by data centres will still be a fraction of the world’s total energy-related emissions, an estimated 1.5 per cent. It further argues that widespread adoption of AI could make a host of activities more efficient, reducing emissions in other areas. This may be from the optimisation of industrial processes, scientific research or technology innovation. The IEA estimates that the broad application of existing AI-led solutions could lead to emissions reductions of up to 5 per cent by 2035. It claims this will offset the increase in emissions generated by data centre demand. A separate report from Energy Intelligence predicted a doubling of energy demand, but also framed AI as a key enabler of the clean energy transition.  It cited smarter grid management, cost reduction in low-carbon technologies and enhanced integration of renewables as benefits AI could bring. It further argued that advances in processor efficiency, cooling technologies, and algorithm optimisation will ultimately curb AI’s high energy demands. Although the IEA report looks favourably on the future of AI and its climate impact, it notes that this outcome is not automatic. “It is vital to note that there is currently no momentum that could ensure the widespread adoption of these AI applications,” the report states. “Therefore, their aggregate impact, even in 2035, could be marginal if the necessary enabling conditions are not created.” Realising AI’s potential will require concentrated action on multiple fronts. In particular, it notes the positive impact AI could have in the energy industry through the optimisation of grids and distribution, one area in which AI is woefully underused at present. It also admits that investment in low-carbon electricity generation is crucial, particularly when it comes to supplying energy-hungry data centres. Some players are making strides in this. Amazon is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy worldwide. It says that over 90 per cent of its operations, including its Amazon Web Services data centres, are already powered by renewables.  Digital Reality, with over 300 data centres worldwide, has committed to renewable energy. Today, 100 per cent of its European portfolio’s energy needs are matched with renewable energy purchases. But it’s not easy going green in the data centre business. The intermittency of renewable energy sources presents a challenge, as do geographical limitations, which may impact the availability of clean energy sources.  With most of the world’s biggest data centres in the US, this will be where the largest growth in energy demand will be seen.  By the end of the decade, energy consumption from data centres is projected to outstrip that of all other energy-intensive activities combined (production of aluminium, concrete, chemicals, etc.), according to the IEA report. Today, US data centres rely on fossil fuels, mainly natural gas. IEA doesn’t see this changing, particularly with the current administration’s focus on dirty fuels.  Just this week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order instructing cabinet members to identify regions where coal-powered infrastructure can support AI data centres. In the state of Louisiana, plans are already in place to construct a large-scale gas power plant specifically to cater to a massive new data centre being built by Meta. IEA’s report presents a scenario that will only be achievable with concerted efforts and political support. Depending on the priorities at the time, it’s just as likely that AI could be used to find new oil and gas reserves as to detect methane leaks or optimise grids. Considering the notion of AI ‘offsetting’ its own emissions needs to be taken in context. Carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, so even if AI does eventually find ways to cut more emissions than it produces, it won’t cancel out the damage it will do along the way. ""The widespread adoption of existing AI applications could lead to emissions reductions that are far larger than emissions from data centres - but also far smaller than what is needed to address climate change,"" the report concludes."

The S&P 500 index was down 0.4% in early trading, a continuation of the sharp slide that erased a big chunk of its historic gains from the middle of the week, after Trump paused tariffs on many countries outside of China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 232 points, or 0.6%, as of around 3:35 pm CEST, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.1% lower. Such modest moves, though, are hardly assured to last through the day if recent history is a guide. Stocks have been swinging not just day to day but hour to hour as investors struggle to make out where Trump’s trade war is heading and whether it will cause a global recession. China announced on Friday that it was boosting its tariffs on US exports to 125%. This is to counter the US recently imposing a 125% tariff on China, on top of its existing 20% levy. “The US alternately raising abnormally high tariffs on China has become a numbers game, which has no practical economic significance, and will become a joke in the history of the world economy,"" a Finance Ministry spokesman said in a statement announcing the new tariffs. “However, if the US insists on continuing to substantially infringe on China’s interests, China will resolutely counter and fight to the end,"" he added. Such rising tensions between the world’s two-largest economies can cause widespread damage for the world, even after Trump announced a 90-day pause on some of his tariffs for other countries. The price of gold rose more than 2% to $3,250 per ounce following the latest escalation. Gold is typically considered a safe haven asset, which sees increased demand during times of economic and political uncertainty. Other assets that have historically been seen as safe havens aren’t seeing the same wave, though. The value of the US dollar fell again against everything from the euro to the Japanese yen to the Canadian dollar. Prices for longer-term Treasury bonds, which are essentially IOUs from the US government, also fell. This is at odds with historical trends, where Treasuries had long been seen as one of the safest possible investments. The drop in prices for Treasuries in turn sent their yields higher, because investors are essentially demanding to get paid more for the risk of holding them. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.50% from 4.40% late Thursday and from just 4.01% at the end of last week. Several reasons could be behind the rise in yields, including investors outside the United States selling their US bonds because of the trade war. Regardless of the reason for their rise, higher yields crank up pressure on the stock market and raise rates for mortgages and other loans going to US households and businesses. Not even a set of stronger-than-expected profit reports from some of the biggest US banks was able to lift the stock market. JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo all reported stronger profit for the first three months of the year than analysts expected. JPMorgan Chase rose 1.6%, but Morgan Stanley slipped 0.2%, and Wells Fargo dropped 3%. Another better-than-expected report on inflation also did little to help the mood. It could give the Federal Reserve more leeway to cut interest rates if it feels the need to support the economy. Lower rates would help make obtaining mortgages and other loans cheaper. But Friday’s report on inflation at the wholesale level was backward looking, measuring March’s price levels. The worry is that inflation will feel more upward pressure in coming months as Trump’s tariffs make their way through the economy. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed around the world. Germany’s DAX lost 1.6%, but the FTSE 100 in London added 0.3% as the government revealed that the UK economy enjoyed a growth spurt in February. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 3%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbed 1.1%."

Here’s all we know about its proposal to tackle overtourism,"Norway has updated its plans for a visitor tax that hopes to tackle the negative effects of overtourism.  The government has announced it is lowering the proposed fee that local authorities will be able to charge tourists.  Minister of Trade and Industry Cecilie Myrseth has confirmed the tax will now be three per cent of the cost of an overnight stay - instead of five per cent. Norway is experiencing a surge in arrivals as holidaymakers seek cooler climes, hitting a record-breaking 16.7 million overnight stays during the summer months of 2024. Norway’s tourist tax will be an optional charge that can be levied at the discretion of local authorities.  The revenue will be used to fund projects that will benefit both residents and tourists, such as maintaining hiking trails and installing public toilets.  If implemented by a municipality, the levy will apply to visitors staying in all overnight accommodation, including hotels, hostels, campsites and short-term rentals. Local authorities can also adjust the fee depending on the season, Myrseth confirmed.  “It is not the case that we have year-round tourism throughout the country, but in some places, there are parts of the year that are particularly demanding, and the expenses that the residents have to pay for are particularly high,” Myserth told Norwegian public broadcaster NRK. At the moment, there is no fixed date for the introduction of the visitor fee, though reports say it may come in as early as this summer.  The government still needs to have the bill detailing the tax approved by parliament, but several parties appear to be in opposition to the new levy.  The travel and tourism branch of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NHO) has warned it could put tourists off visiting the destination.  “We are now in a very serious situation. Introducing the tourist tax now is, in any case, madness,” a spokesperson from the NHO told NRK earlier this week. The proposed tax has also been criticised for only targeting overnight visitors, leaving cruise passengers, day-trippers, and campervanners staying overnight in free public areas not required to pay. Opponents argue that these are some of the most damaging kinds of visitors, particularly in frequently overwhelmed cruise destinations like the Lofoten Islands and Geiranger fjord.  The Norwegian government has been mulling the introduction of a tourist tax for several years in reaction to surging visitor numbers.  Sweltering temperatures in traditional summer destinations like Italy and Spain are driving a trend for ‘coolcations’ in northern Europe.  Bolstering this is the rising interest in experiencing after-dark phenomena - dubbed ‘noctourism’ - such as the northern lights.  Norway is considered one of the best places for aurora-chasing, and the celestial spectacle is proving to be particularly visible in 2025. "

According to domestic media, the group departed from the port city of Brindisi, though authorities have yet to confirm the migrants’ nationalities or further details. The individuals are now being held at two Italian-built and operated facilities in Shëngjin and Gjadër, which were initially constructed to process asylum claims for migrants intercepted in the Mediterranean Sea.  However, since their launch in October, legal challenges have restricted full use of the centres, with some migrants returned to Italy after courts refused to uphold their detention abroad. The duration of the migrants’ stay in Albania remains unclear, though under Italian law, rejected asylum seekers can be held for up to 18 months pending deportation. The transfers come after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government recently ordered the Albanian fast-track asylum centres to also detain rejected asylum seekers facing deportation. Rights groups and legal experts have denounced the move, raising concerns over the legality and precedent it may set. “They need to show they are doing something with this incredibly expensive structure,” said Meghan Benton of the Migration Policy Institute. She noted that other EU countries, including the Netherlands, have expressed interest in similar arrangements with states like Uganda. Francesco Ferri, a migration expert with ActionAid who joined a delegation of NGOs and Italian lawmakers monitoring the transfers in Albania, said the move lacked a clear legal basis.  He explained that there is no provision in Italian law, EU legislation or the Albania-Italy agreement that permits such deportation of rejected asylum seekers. ""For us it is unacceptable,"" he said. Since the signing of the €800 million bilateral deal in November 2023, the centres have largely remained inactive due to legal barriers and pressure from human rights groups who argue the agreement violates international law and endangers migrants’ rights. Under the five-year agreement, up to 3,000 migrants intercepted by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month can be processed in Albania. Those granted asylum are relocated to Italy, while others face deportation directly from Albanian soil. However, the first three groups of 73 migrants transferred last autumn and winter were returned to Italy within hours, as magistrates refused to validate their detention outside the EU. According to Italy’s Interior Ministry, 11,438 migrants have landed on Italian shores so far this year — fewer than the 16,090 recorded during the same period last year. "

Water levels in the Caspian Sea - which is bordered by Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan - are falling as rising temperatures mean more water is evaporating than flowing in. Even if global warming is limited to below 2°C, it is likely that the Caspian Sea will drop by 5 to 10 m, shaving 112,000 km² off its current size of 387,000 km². Left unchecked, climate change could see water levels drop by as much as 21 m by 2100.  Researchers at the UK’s University of Leeds have now mapped what that means for the region’s biodiversity and human infrastructure. With many of the Caspian Sea’s most important areas located in shallow water, they say that urgent action is required to protect species and coastal communities. Caspian seals are found exclusively in the brackish Caspian Sea, where they have adapted to wide swings in temperature.  Between January and March, the seals give birth to their white-coated pups on the ice in the northern Caspian Sea. But even a 5m decline could reduce the area of this habitat by up to 81 per cent, according to the new study, putting huge pressure on an already reduced population. The Caspian seal was listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2008, due to a wide range of stressors, including oil and gas drilling, shipping, and the already evident signs of habitat alteration from climate change.  The shrinking sea will also make the seals’ haul-out sites - areas where they rest on land - inaccessible. Though receding water levels may create some new islands, it is not yet known if they will be suitable alternatives. The diminutive seals are the obvious ‘poster children’ of the Caspian Sea’s plight, but many other species are threatened by its retreat, and the environmental impacts are far-reaching. The Caspian Basin was once home to the world's most diverse array of sturgeons, an ancient family of large fish. All five Caspian sturgeon species which spawn in rivers are critically endangered due to overfishing for their meat and caviar.  Now, the shallower parts of the sea that sturgeons inhabit in summer and autumn are facing a potential reduction in size of up to 45 per cent, which may stop the fish reaching their spawning sites in the Volga, Ural and other inflowing rivers. The Caspian Sea is also a globally important habitat for birds migrating between Europe, Asia and Africa. These birds rely on coastal lagoons and reed beds for resting, shelter and food during their migrations, but such habitats are vulnerable to loss as waters recede.  In total, a 10m decline in water levels would wipe out four out of 10 ecosystem types unique to the Caspian Sea. Marine protected zones, safeguarded for their biodiversity, would almost completely vanish - except for a very small amount of water in Kazakhstan. More than 15 million people live around the coasts of the five Caspian countries, and they rely on the sea for fishing, shipping and trade. In the northern Caspian, the findings show that some settlements, ports and industrial facilities could end up being stranded far from new shorelines.  Ports in Baku (Azerbaijan), Anzali (Iran), and Aktau (Kazakhstan) are expected to see increases in distance to shore of 1 km or more, while Turkmenbashi (Turkmenistan) and Lagan (a planned site in Russia) could see that distance grow by 16 km and 115 km. Coastal communities in the north are likely to be hit hardest as income from fishing disappears. And climate change could serve an economic double whammy, as loss of water from the Caspian would alter the regional climate - leading to lower rainfall across central Asia, making agricultural work harder.  There are also pressing health concerns. Once exposed, the dry seabed is likely to release dust containing industrial contaminants and salt, posing serious threats to human health. It could be a similar story to the Aral Sea - where salty dust storms from the dried-up sea bed continue to make people sick. Given the manifold risks climate change poses to the Caspian Sea, time is of the essence. “Some Caspian Sea level decline appears unavoidable, even with action to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions,” says Dr Simon Goodman from the School of Biology at the University of Leeds, who supervised the research. “However, with the anticipated effects unfolding over a few decades, it should be possible to find ways to protect biodiversity while safeguarding human interests and wellbeing.  “That might sound like a long timescale, but, given the immense political, legislative and logistical challenges involved, it is advisable to start action as soon as possible to give the best chance of success.”  Welcoming the study’s important warnings, Dr Elchin Mamedov from the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources in Azerbaijan says it shows “the need to enhance regional and international cooperation to help manage the impacts.”"

JPMorgan Chase, the US’ largest lender, said that net income in the first three months of the year had risen to $14.6 billion (€12.8bn), a 9% annual jump. That was above market expectations, although CEO Jamie Dimon warned of uncertainty ahead due to President Donald Trump’s ongoing trade war and other geopolitical tensions. Dimon said a strong performance by the bank’s markets division helped lift it to another strong quarter, despite looming challenges ahead. JPMorgan’s earnings per share rose to $5.07 (€4.46) per share from $4.44 (€3.90) a year ago. The result beat Wall Street profit projections of $4.63 a share, according to the data firm FactSet. Total managed revenue hit $46bn (€40.4bn), up from the $41.9bn (€36.8bn) a year ago. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $44bn. Trump’s tariff rates — currently at 10% for most US trading partners and at 145% for China — have sent financial markets into dizzying fluctuations for weeks and created an enormous amount of economic uncertainty. That’s bad for banks that are reliant on stability, which in turn allows healthy consumers and businesses to borrow money. JPMorgan’s trading desk thrived in the first three months of 2025, helped by the market's volatility, even before Trump rolled out his massive “Liberation Day” tariffs on 2 April. The bank’s market revenue rose 21% in the period, with equities revenue up 48% year-on-year. Morgan Stanley also beat Wall Street’s first-quarter projections, which the New York-based investment bank attributed to a strong performance from its equities trading division. Net income came to $4.3bn (€3.8bn), while the firm brought in a record revenue of $17.7bn (€15.6bn). Wells Fargo also reported on Friday, with the San Francisco bank posting first-quarter net income of $4.89bn (€4.3bn), or $1.39 (€1.22) per share. That topped analysts’ forecast for earnings of $1.23 per share. Investment firm BlackRock, meanwhile, announced on Friday a first-quarter net income of $1.51bn (€1.3bn). The New York-based company said it had net income of $9.64 per share (€8.47). Earnings, adjusted for costs related to mergers and acquisitions and amortisation costs, were $11.30 (€9.93) per share, exceeding Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $10.25 per share. The investment firm posted revenue of $5.28bn (€4.6bn) in the period, which missed Wall Street forecasts. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $5.33bn."

The Office for National Statistics found that the British economy grew by 0.5% in February, ahead of market expectations for a more modest increase of 0.2%. It also revised up January’s figure to no change from the previous estimate of a 0.1% decline. This was also the strongest monthly figure in eleven months. Industrial production rose 1.5% in February, bouncing back from a 0.5% fall in January, mainly boosted by higher manufacturing output. Production of optical products, as well as electronic and computer goods also increased 9.8% in February, along with utilities supply, which advanced 2%, despite a 3% decline in mining. Services rose 0.3% in February, following a 0.1% increase in January, primarily driven by consultancy, computer programming, publishing and telecommunications. Similarly, construction edged up 0.4% in February, bouncing back from a 0.3% fall in January, boosted by repair and maintenance. UK GDP also advanced 0.6% in the three months to January. Although February's GDP report would usually boost investor sentiment, the recent market turmoil prompted by Trump's rapidly changing tariffs is expected to lead to a global downturn, as businesses and consumers retrench in the face of the heightened economic uncertainty. China’s decision to raise tariffs on US goods from 84% to 125% from Saturday has only added to fears that the world’s two biggest economies are heading for a drawn-out and damaging trade war. While welcoming Friday’s growth figures, British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves acknowledged the uncertain outlook. “The world has changed and we have witnessed that change in recent weeks,” she said. “I know this is an anxious time for families who are worried about the cost of living and British businesses who are worried about what this change means for them"". The Labour government has said raising the UK's economic growth is the number one priority over the next five years. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-9, the British economy’s growth performance has been historically lacklustre. ""Looking ahead, we expect February’s reprieve to be short-lived, and think the ongoing trade war will suppress growth over the coming years. Admittedly, there is little certainty over where the ‘rules of the game’ end up on trade, and we think the 90-day reprieve issued by President Trump will provide little clarity for businesses and households,"" said Pantheon Macroeconomics in an email note. However, it highlighted that the UK was relatively more insulated from the direct impact of more trade barriers with the US, mainly because it exports more services than goods."

It's a feeling. I want to go back. But back where?” That feeling, of searching for some intangible comfort, has always been core to the band’s output. Ever since the solitary creaks and layered vocals of debut album ‘For Emma, Forever Ago’, recorded in a remote Wisconsin cabin, Bon Iver has become synonymous with a woodsy, folkloric feel — their music a liminal space in which quiet transitions emerge and emotions thaw.  It’s an identity that frontman Justin Vernon has been trying to escape throughout his almost two-decade career, each new album more distant from the last via increasingly abstract electronic experimentation.  From the dense dreamscapes of 2011’s ‘Bon Iver, Bon Iver’ to the prism pop of 2016’s ‘22, A Million’, listeners are always being taken somewhere new - yet the feelings conjured remain the same. Few other artists have the ability to capture longing in the same way; the endless cycles of our minds attempting to find acceptance.  Six years after 2019’s ‘i,i’, it feels like Vernon has finally reached the place he’s been yearning for. Told in two parts, ‘SABLE, fABLE’ is Bon Iver’s most optimistic album yet - a sparkling embrace of change, hope and the beauty to be found within life’s ephemerality. Composed in isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, the first three tracks — released as an EP last year — mark the beginning of an emotional arc, starting from a place of anxiety. In ‘THINGS BEHIND THINGS BEHIND THINGS’, Vernon tries to expel it — his trademark repetitions turning thoughts into noise into nothing: “I would like the feeling / I would like the feeling / I would like the feeling gone.”   This restlessness settles as we transition into ‘SPEYSIDE’, a calming contemplation of contrition that cradles guilt while letting it gently slip away into acceptance: “I really know now what had hold on me”. While the discomfort lingers, the music slows — and learns to sit with it.  Many of Bon Iver’s best, and most notable works have emerged from regret and heartbreak — caught in the gentle swells of tracks like ‘Skinny Love’ and ‘Wisconsin’. But ‘SABLE, fABLE’ is the first time we hear Vernon truly move beyond that cycle. It’s a sadness broken by the scattered solidarity of piano keys and saxophone wails of ‘AWARDS SEASON’, lyrics flickering with a new-found hope: “I can handle / Way more than I can handle.” The rest of the album is vibrant with the sweetness of being in the moment, the funky fizzles of ‘Everything Is Peaceful Love’ hitting like warm rays. That soaring croon of “And damn if i'm not climbing up a tree” reminds us we can rise above the wreckage of painful experiences — and find contentment. Even when wrestling with the confusions of desire in tracks such as ‘Walk Home’ and ‘If Only I Could Wait’ (a collaboration with Danielle Haim), there’s serenity to every tumbling harmony and tender piano melody. The familiar elements are still there: glitching soundscapes and falsetto, but no longer imprisoned in the wilderness of rumination. If Bon Iver's music once felt like grasping for a feeling, 'SABLE, fABLE' is the release — a recognition that true comfort comes from being at peace with the present. Wherever that may be. ‘SABLE, fABLE’ by Bon Iver is out now."

In 2024, over 36 million bags were mishandled by airlines - either lost, stolen or damaged. That’s around seven bags for every thousand checked in. While many bags are ultimately reunited with their owner, a small percentage are lost forever.  Most bags contain nothing more than mundane items of clothing and a few toiletries. But some people travel with much stranger belongings - a suit of armour, a toilet seat, and even a glass eye have all been retrieved from lost bags over the past year. According to Unclaimed Baggage, a US-based retailer that sells items from unclaimed airline luggage, these odd items are just the tip of the iceberg. Its Found Report uncovers the strangest, most expensive and most commonly lost items reclaimed from airline baggage. ""Since 1970, we've unpacked more than just belongings—we've discovered the unique stories behind travellers' journeys,"" said CEO & President Bryan Owens. ""From the most valuable to the trendy, the 'Found Report' gives readers a first-class seat to the most compelling tales uncovered from the previous year."" Some of the items found by Unclaimed Baggage in travellers' suitcases last year are head-scratchingly strange. Take, for instance, the full breastplate from a medieval suit of armour or the Roman soldier’s helmet. The company didn’t say if these came out of the same bag, but given they’re from different historical periods, they probably didn’t - no self-respecting live-action role-player would dare mix up their eras. One bag contained a freeze-dried chicken's foot, which you could wash down with a jar of whiskey containing a preserved rattlesnake from another. If that creeps you out, how about opening a bag to find no clothes, no toothpaste, just dozens of enormous spiders and beetles preserved in cases. Historical items were flying around the world more than you’d expect. Passengers’ luggage contained all sorts of ancient treasures, from an antique mustache curler to a decades-old magician’s hat.  Probably the most disturbing find, however, was an antique French book on performing exorcisms. Who knows what the ultimate intent for that particular item would have been? And then there was the just plain weird - a silicon pregnancy belly, a pair of silicone butt pads and a full set of dentures complete with tooth jewels. One bag in particular had the Unclaimed Baggage workers hot under the collar. The team said, “There are heavy bags, and then there was this bag.” When the heavyweight suitcase was hauled in to be unpacked, workers were eager to see what was inside. Gold bars? Ancient artefacts? Something special for sure, given its ridiculous weight. Sadly, the case opened to reveal… rocks. Nothing else. Just rocks. Perhaps this was a misguided geologist's collection or some strange attempt at weight training, but we’ll never know. Not all the items recovered were just plain weird - some were weirdly expensive, raising questions about why people wouldn’t try harder to track them down. The most expensive item found in an unclaimed bag was an 18-karat white gold solitaire diamond ring, thought to be worth around $39,000 (€34,000). There was also a gold President Oyster Rolex watch, valued at around $20,000 (€17,500). Among the other lost luxuries were designer garments from the likes of Chanel and Alexander McQueen worth thousands, and pieces of Louis Vuitton luggage that on their own would fetch more than $10k (€17,500+).  Expensive cameras, designer dog carriers and a $7,000 (€6,200) handmade flute all came out of lost bags last year too. It’s not only lost luggage from airlines that tell a tale about how we travel today. Uber’s annual lost and found index, also released this week, details what its drivers find left behind in their cars. Predictably, the most commonly lost items include phones, wallets, keys and headphones. An incredible 1.7 million phones were left in rideshare cars last year, and more than 70 Nintendo Switch consoles. But those aren’t the strangest things Uber drivers have found, not by a long way. Among the most ‘unique’ finds were a chainsaw, a DNA testing kit, 10 live lobsters and a urinal. Apparently we’re prone to leaving things in hotel rooms, too. Hotels.com released its ‘Innsights’ report last year, revealing a car tyre, an engagement ring, a tooth, two full-leg casts, stacks of cash, a pet lizard, and a chick were all among the items forgotten by travellers when they checked out. TFL, the company that runs the London public transport network, has a warehouse of unclaimed belongings and gets around 6,000 new items every week. Among these lost items have been a box of cooked frogs, a glass jar filled with bats, a Dalek costume and a puffer fish. While the contents of some of these bags beg the question ‘why’, the fact remains that if you don’t want your weird travel companions to be discovered, don’t lose your bag. Avoiding checking a bag in is a great strategy, as your luggage will stay with you at all times. Some airlines have quite generous allowances for carry-on baggage, so consider if you can avoid the unknown by travelling light. If you do need to check in a bag, make sure you can spot it from a mile away. Bright straps, coloured ribbons and unique stickers will all help your luggage stand out on the carousel among all the other black cases. Many lost bag incidents occur during connecting flights. If you can, choose a direct flight to minimise the chance of disruption during the connection. For the ultimate peace of mind, Apple’s AirTag product has become a passenger favourite for keeping an eye on your bag. As they rely on Bluetooth via the ‘Find My’ network, tracking can be more reliable than GPS alone and can help you pinpoint a missing bag rapidly from anywhere in the world. If the worst does happen and you become separated from your luggage, it’s essential to report it immediately to the company you were travelling with. For air travel, the airport will ask you to complete a Property Irregularity Report (PIR), which will generate a reference number to help you track progress. While the airline is looking for your luggage, they will usually reimburse you for essential items you need to purchase, such as toiletries or clothes. If after 21 days the bag still hasn’t been found, you’ll be able to claim compensation. Airlines have a maximum liability for lost luggage, typically around €1,600 per passenger, but it does vary. Any unclaimed luggage is usually sold, donated or disposed of. In the US, airlines will search for the owners of bags for 90 days, but if the luggage is still unclaimed by that point, it ends up with Unclaimed Baggage at its store in Scottsboro, Alabama. The contents are catalogued and either placed for sale in its retail store, repurposed for charity or recycled. Ultimately, you can spare yourself the grief of losing a treasured possession by simply not travelling with it at all. While you might love them very much, it's probably best to leave the armor, arachnids, and ancient artefacts where they belong—safely at home."

Be prepared for footwear checks and one-way systems,"Italy’s Cinque Terre is famous for its sunny-coloured, cliff-clinging villages linked by vertiginous walking paths.  The hiking routes draw thousands of visitors in spring and summer, to the extent that the Cinque Terre national park authorities have had to introduce safety measures.  With the upcoming Easter holidays expected to be particularly busy, officials are tightening regulations.  During peak season, one-way systems are often implemented on popular stretches of the Cinque Terre’s hiking routes.  The Sentiero Verde Azzurro winds all the way from Monterosso al Mare to Riomaggiore, passing through Vernazza, Corniglia and Manarola on the way.  On the days predicted to be the busiest in April, May and June this year, the Monterosso-Vernazza leg of the trail will be one-way from 9am to 2pm.  During this time, walkers will only be able to go from the town of Monterosso towards Vernazza, the direction that 70 per cent of visitors choose according to people counts done in previous years. The one-way system will be active 19-21 and 25-27 April, 1, 29 and 31 May, and 1-2 June.  “This measure, already successfully tested in 2023 and 2024, is aimed at improving the use of the trail and ensuring the safety of visitors by avoiding dangerous intersections and congestion along a particularly narrow and steep path,” the Cinque Terre national park authorities say on their website. It also aims to protect the ancient dry stone walls that run along this section of the path.  To enter the park, hikers also need to purchase a Cinque Terre Trekking Card, which starts at €7.50 per day or €15 on peak days.  Park authorities brought in a ban on open or smooth-soled footwear (like flip-flops) in 2019.  Inappropriate shoes can cost a would-be hiker a fine ranging from €50 to €2,500.  In the latest online guidelines for visiting the park, officials now say checks will be carried out to ensure walkers are properly kitted out.   In 2024, the famous Via dell’Amore or ‘Path of Love’, reopened after being closed for over a decade by a landslide.  Known as the most romantic walk in the world, it connects Riomaggiore and Manarola. As one of the most famous stretches of the Cinque Terre coastline, the Via dell’Amore is massively popular with visitors. To curb overtourism, there is a booking system for those who want to walk the path. The number of visitors allowed on the path each hour is capped at 400, and walkers have to book their tickets online or purchase one at the park's ticket booths. The tickets cost €12.50, which also includes the Cinque Terre Trekking Card and entrance to the Castle of Riomaggiore. As well as bringing in restrictions, park authorities are seeking to reduce overcrowding by reminding visitors that there are plenty of other routes to explore.  Other sections of the Sentiero Verde Azzurro will remain passable in both directions this summer.  The same goes for the rest of the park’s hiking network, which includes over 130km of routes between the coast and mountain ridges.  “It is a wide and suggestive network, which offers valid alternatives that are less congested and equally panoramic,” park authorities say.

26866790-14eb-44be-9077-5bcd51472c22,https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/04/11/la-nina-has-ended-after-three-weak-months-what-does-it-mean-for-europes-weather,04.11.2025 14:00 GMT+1,La Niña has ended after three weak months. What does it mean for Europe’s weather?,"La Niña, the natural cooling flip side of the better-known and warmer El Niño climate phenomenon, has dwindled away after just three months.  The La Niña that appeared in January, months later than forecast, was a weak one, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said on Thursday. Earth is now in a neutral stage of the El Niño Southern Oscillation cycle, which is generally the most benign of the three states that influence hurricane formation, droughts, floods and global temperatures.  NOAA forecasts the current neutral setting to last most, if not all, of 2025.  That makes longer-term weather forecasts a bit trickier because one of the major factors used to determine global patterns is not pushing one way or the other. La Niña is an irregular rising of unusually cold water in a key part of the central equatorial Pacific that changes weather patterns worldwide.  It typically brings more Atlantic hurricanes in the summer, but it won't be a factor this year.  In the United States, La Niñas tend to cause drier weather in the south and west and often make it wetter in parts of Indonesia, northern Australia and southern Africa. Studies have found that La Niñas tend to be costlier than El Niños and neutral conditions. Last year, this phase of the cycle brought drought, food shortages and deadly heat in some parts of the world. The biggest sign of La Niña in Europe can be found during winter. This is because of something called a teleconnection mechanism - large-scale weather patterns in other parts of the world that interact with those closer to home. Two different areas in the Pacific are being monitored: the Central Pacific (CP) and the Eastern Pacific (EP). It is important to differentiate between the two because what is happening in these two basins has different impacts on our weather. “If the strongest cold anomaly during La Niña is in the EP region, the North Atlantic and western European region tends to weaker storms or low-pressure systems and more blocking highs which often leads to drier and sometimes colder conditions,” Lars Lowinski, a meteorologist at Weather & Radar, told Euronews Green earlier this year. “However, a cold anomaly in the CP region tends to result in a pattern that resembles a so-called positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) pattern, with a stronger jet stream and more storm activity across the near Atlantic and western Europe, resulting in milder, wetter and windier conditions.” That’s what happens in theory, Lowinski clarified, but other major players can affect our European weather like the NAO, winds in the stratosphere near the equator and even tropical convection over the Indian Ocean. However, with the current return to neutral conditions before summer 2025, there likely won’t be any strong tendencies either way this time. Despite this, 2025 is still likely to be among the three hottest years on record, according to the UK’s weather and climate agency, the Met Office. And, with this March the hottest on record in Europe, there could be harsher heat waves and wildfires to come this summer."

The land, naval, aerospace and guided weapons sectors all need these critical raw materials, according to a study from the think tank International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).   A modern main battle tank uses raw materials in its sensors, weapons, armour, hull and communications. Sensors are increasingly complex and rely on a range of critical materials.    For instance, the basic glass and mirrors utilise silicon and ceramics, while infrared and night-vision sights – which are key enablers in low-visibility environments – can contain mercury, cadmium telluride, germanium, copper and tantalum.  Copper and germanium are classified as strategic raw materials by the EU, which has a 17% and 42% reliance on imports for each, respectively. China is the largest global producer of both materials, averaging 38% of global copper production and 83% of global germanium production between 2016 and 2020. Modern warships also utilise a variety of critical materials in their composition, although the maritime domain uses fewer than the aerospace, land or guided weapons sectors. Nonetheless, there is still a high requirement for many materials deemed to have a moderate supply-chain risk, such as aluminium, iron (and steel), and copper. For example, aluminium is heavily used in shipbuilding, including for decks, elements of the superstructure and internal compartments. The EU is 58% reliant on imports of aluminium, with China being its largest global producer. Between 2016 and 2020, China accounted for an average of 56% of global aluminium production. To mitigate supply risks, the EU is making efforts to promote the domestic extraction, processing and recycling of these critical materials.  Besides the EU's 2024 Critical Raw Materials Act, individual member states are developing their own national strategies. France's Military Programming Law for 2024–2030 allows the defence ministry to request, via decree, the creation of industrial stockpiles of materials, components and semi-finished products that may be needed by the armed forces. The Spanish Defence Industrial Strategy 2023 also included references and recommendations to improve and strengthen both the supply chain and the provision of raw materials. Similarly, Germany's 2024 National Security and Defence Industry Strategy paves the way for the use of a national raw-materials fund to strengthen supply security in the security and defence sector and states that there should be improved monitoring of supply chains for critical raw materials required by the defence sector. Other European countries, including Italy, Poland and the UK, are also developing strategies related to raw materials and the potential exploitation of national resources. However, specific government documents focused on defence are not yet available."

That uptick was first outlined in the ""Kleptotrace"" report by Transcrime, a research centre at the Catholic University of Milan, which was presented this week to Europol, the EU police cooperation agency based in The Hague. The study was co-funded by the European Union and focused mainly on sanctions imposed by the bloc on Russia and Kremlin-linked oligarchs since 2014, the year of Moscow's unilateral annexation of Crimea, which have been ramped up since the 2022 full-scale invasion. The report illustrates how dense, shadowy networks of intermediary companies — often fictitious and represented by frontmen — are operating in jurisdictions not aligned with the sanctions regimes and have turned sanctions into lucrative money-making machines. Unsuspecting European companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), often fall foul of these schemes, as they lack the necessary tools and security infrastructure to recognise potential risk partners. ""The measures were introduced very quickly and the larger economic operators were able to set up adaptation systems,"" Giovanni Nicolazzo, a researcher at Transcrime and co-author of the report, explained to Euronews. ""Small and medium-sized companies, on the other hand, continue to have difficulties in assessing the sanction risk of their stakeholders,"" he added. Obtaining reliable information about the organisations companies do business with costs time and money. And in the absence of automated systems, it then becomes a matter for transnational investigations using professional firms — often involving lawyers and accountants — which can leave an SME with an exorbitant bill. ""In addition to identifying the company's owner, it is necessary to reconstruct the entire supply chain, right down to the end users,"" Nicolazzo said. ""Those who do not have access to adequate tools or databases end up relying on simple self-declarations by the supplier or customer, which alone are not enough."" But for experts and investigators, a self-declaration is too easy to submit and not a sufficient enough background check. The sectors most exposed to this type of incident are electronic components, mechanical engineering, aeronautics and technologies for both civil and military purposes. The European Union has initiated a process to help companies with this process. Called the EU Sanctions Helpdesk, it aims to assist primarily SMEs to conduction due diligence on who exactly they're working with. According to Transcrime's research, the very ownership structures of many European companies could belong to entities subject to sanctions. At the time Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine started, thousands of companies within the EU and in Ukraine and other European countries were owned by at least 342 nationals of the Russian Federation who were subject to sanctions. The Kleptotrace report also says that in the first months of 2022, almost 10,000 companies were owned by sanctioned persons. And these are just the official, known figures. However, the responsibility for implementing sanctions remains at the national level, and sometimes, that is insufficient. Stephen Piccinino, an official of the Malta Financial Services Authority says that in wartime circumstances ""a state that is serious about enforcing sanctions should investigate the activities of large conglomerates in its national territory."" The views expressed by Stephen Piccinino are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Malta Financial Services Authority ""Be particularly careful if it possesses resources such as precious metals. And above all, check for internal corruption, particularly if there are any domestic politicians with past links to sanctioned individuals or entities,"" Piccinino told Euronews. A statistical update is currently being carried out by the Transcrime research centre. Although the final figures aren't yet available, researchers conclude that the number of companies linked to sanctioned Russian entities — either directly or indirectly — may not have decreased sufficiently since 2022. The dense network of global financial markets offers protected channels to those wanting to evade sanctions. Very often, these are the same routes used by organised crime for money laundering operations, as revealed by Europol in its EU Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment 2025 report published in March. Experience and banking contacts accumulated by corrupt political sectors are crucial to sanctions evasion networks. ""If, for example, I am a corrupt politician from a European country and I want to conclude a transaction to build energy infrastructure in a sanctioned country, I can conclude the contractual agreement, and I receive the payments via a risky but non-sanctioned country to the terminal bank account in my country, because I know that my bank does not do the necessary checks,"" Piccinino explained. Piccinino further explained that in his experience, intermediary banks are located ""in well-known countries"" such as Caribbean nations and are financial entities already in contact with ""banks that do not apply the so-called know-your-customer procedures and also have poor transaction control systems."" According to Transcrime, most frequently under the lens of national authorities are sectoral sanctions evasions, which account for 80% of all evasion cases. Sectoral sanctions are measures against entire industrial or service sectors. The companies involved are often intermediary companies — or so-called paper companies — that formally exist but have no real economic activity, with fictitious headquarters and insubstantial assets. ""Often these are entities that would have no economic justification for acquiring such assets. A thorough audit would reveal suspicious addresses, links with other similar companies and the absence of indicators of real operations,"" Nicolazzo clarified. According to the Kleptotrace report, on average, three paper companies and at least five countries are involved between the seller and the buyer in every transaction that circumvents sanctions. The payment methods are those typical of organised crime, namely bank transactions through offshore accounts and the exchange of luxury goods, such as large pieces of jewellery, real estate, and shares. Europol has already highlighted how difficult it is to effectively restrict economic exchanges in the context of high interdependence between states, private companies and transnational criminal networks."

Presumably referring to the trade in goods, Trump said on Monday as he rejected a ‘zero-to-zero’ tariff offer from Brussels that the US had a $350 deficit with the EU. “One of the ways that can disappear easily and quickly is they’re gonna have to buy our energy from us, because they need it…We can knock off $350bn in one week,” Trump told reporters in Washington. Then president-elect, Trump had already warned on his social media platform in December that it would be “TARIFFS all the way!!!” unless the European Union ramped up energy imports. According to the US government’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, the deficit in 2024 was $235.6 billion – but even that seems to be an order of magnitude larger than the potential European market for American – or indeed any liquefied natural gas. The total value of all of Europe’s energy imports last year – meaning pipeline gas, petroleum and coal in addition to LNG – came to €375.9 billion, according to the EU’s statistics office Eurostat. LNG made up only €41.4bn of this, of which America’s share was just under half, and overall import volumes were down 15% on the previous year. Meanwhile, Europe is ramping up the deployment of renewable energy infrastructure, especially wind and solar, and demand for fossil fuels overall – especially if the EU sticks to its decarbonization agenda – is on a downward trajectory. The uncomfortable fact that the Kremlin’s share of the EU’s market for LNG still stands at 17.5%, and the EU goal of ending all imports of Russian energy by 2027, means there may be some room to increase LNG imports from America in the short term. But EU officials have already poured several buckets of cold water on the idea of a more permanent ramping up of imports on the scale Trump seems to be implying. “We want to avoid over-dependence on any single supplier,” a Commission spokesperson said the day after Trump’s vague offer of a quid pro quo. “We've learned our lesson too well.” Moreover, the EU official noted, the European Commission was not a market actor, and its room for manoeuvre was limited to measures such as reviewing permitting procedures for LNG infrastructure – of which the EU already has a surplus – or exploring ways to pool demand. As for Trump’s figure of $350 bn, it would be “very, very difficult to comment on one number that has been given from the US side”. Energy Commissioner Jørgensen was equally lukewarm in an interview with the Financial Times on Thursday (10 April). There was “potential” for the EU to buy more LNG from the US, but it would need to be “on conditions that are also in line” with European environmental regulations, he said. A piece of legislation of key relevance here is the Methane Regulation, which is set to impose the same monitoring, reporting and verification obligations on exporters to the EU as on domestic operators. It would also block supply contract for fuels whose associated upstream carbon footprint is above a yet-to-be-defined threshold that would likely capture gas extracted by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as is the case for most US production. Since Trump launched his global tariff war, EU officials have reiterated the European environmental and food safety standards were not up for debate. But EU energy officials have been in an “ongoing dialogue” at the “technical level” with their US counterparts about the methane regulation, a spokesperson told Euronews. “Obviously there have been discussions on what the implications of the methane regulation will be, but this is not something that is taking place particularly now, in the current circumstances.” At the same time, there remains the promised Russian energy exit plan, which was due by the end of March. Jorgensen acknowledged in his interview with the FT that the EU had spent more on Russian energy since 2022 than it had given the Ukraine in aid. But the Commission’s latest provisional agenda suggests that the EU executive has no intention of presenting the plan before the summer, meaning the bloc will have a little over two years at best to implement it. “We are of course very much following what is happening as we are putting together our plan, so that…it will be fit for purpose,” the official said."

Trump’s executive order to impose tariffs on imports from a number of countries sent shockwaves through stock markets, before delaying the majority of them.  Indeed, Trump has paused the higher-band tariffs on countries for 90-days with the exception of China, where he has imposed a 125 per cent tariff on Chinese goods. In retaliation, China has also raised tariffs on the US to 125 per cent.   Now, in a new interview with Sky News, Jordan Belfort – the former stockbroker who pleaded guilty to fraud and related crimes in connection with stock-market manipulation – has said that there is “no way” that Donald Trump is guilty of market manipulation.  Belfort, 62, said that while he is against tariffs generally, Trump’s dramatic intervention was necessary as the US has an “insane” trade imbalance and imports far more than it exports.  He added: “The United States has been drained of its wealth, drained of its factories. It’s not gonna be pretty. There’s going to be pain – but the path we were on before is simply unsustainable. It had to change.”  Belfort went on to say that Democrats criticising the president are just trying to ""earn brownie points with the media and their party"".   Indeed, some of the president’s opponents are saying that Trump has questions to answer after he said it was a “great time to buy” shares before the stock market surged when he paused tariffs.    ""I personally don't find it overly suspicious,” said Belfort. “Especially since he's told it to everybody at once” - referring to the fact Trump made the statement on social media.   ""If he hadn't said anything and told five of his best friends 'I'm gonna ease this tariff situation - you should be buying', that would be illegal.""  Trump's rivals are calling for an urgent inquiry into whether any of his family or administration officials benefited by dealing in the stock market ahead of time.  “Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public’s expense?,” asked Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff in a post on BlueSky. Added Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut on X: “An insider trading scandal is brewing.” Belfort also backed Elon Musk and his controversial government efficiency role, which has forced thousands of jobs cut.  ""I love what is being done because the amount of abuse and waste and fraud, it's absolutely insane,"" said Belfort. ""It's a great thing that's happening."" "

Negotiations over a future free trade agreement continued this week following a series of bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the EU-Ukraine Association Council. A 40-minute exchange on Thursday between EU agriculture Commissioner Christophe Hansen and his Ukrainian counterpart Vitalii Koval was described by an EU official as “frank and constructive.” Currently, trade between the two partners operates under the so-called Autonomous Trade Measures (ATMs) regime, which temporarily suspends all tariffs and quotas on Ukrainian agricultural exports in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. But the scheme, which has already been renewed once, is set to expire in June and cannot be extended further. A formal free trade agreement must now take its place. The current arrangement has drawn criticism in several EU member states, particularly France and Poland, where farmers have protested against the surge in Ukrainian agricultural imports since the removal of trade barriers. Earlier this week, Commissioner Hansen signalled that the EU is considering a shift in direction. “I think it is very clear that it will not be the same quotas and imports that have been allowed over the last period under the autonomous trade measures,” Hansen told MEPs in a hearing. Until now, the Commission had kept its cards close to its chest, avoiding any concrete signals about its negotiating stance. “There will be a new tariff rate quota decided, and we stand ready to discuss this. But it will not be at the same level,” he added. Hansen’s remarks marked the first clear indication that Brussels is preparing to scale back Ukraine’s market access. By contrast, Ukraine is seeking to maintain the status quo. “We would like to start negotiating with our partners in the European Commission in order to preserve the same level of cooperation we have today and implement it in the new agreement,” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the following day. Despite the divergence in positions, the atmosphere between negotiators remains cordial. A Ukrainian official confirmed that discussions are “ongoing” and characterised the general mood of the recent Hansen-Koval meeting as friendly. Koval later issued a statement stressing the importance of a balanced agreement that takes into account both the economic realities of Ukraine and sensitivities for European markets. “Together with Hansen, we have a clear common vision that trade decisions between Ukraine and the EU should be balanced, mutually beneficial, and contribute to stability for farmers and consumers on both sides of the border,” Koval said. With the ATMs set to expire on 5 June, there is little time left to complete the negotiations. A Commission spokesperson confirmed that work on a new proposal is nearing completion. “The Commission remains fully aware of the concerns of EU farmers and member states regarding the sensitivity of certain agricultural imports,” the spokesperson said. Hansen won’t finalise the agreement, as responsibility lies with EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič. But according to three EU and diplomatic sources familiar with the talks, even Šefčovič’s influence may be limited: Given the political stakes, final decisions will likely be made by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s cabinet."

The new rules update the bloc's 2009 Toy Safety Directive with further restrictions on the use of hazardous substances.   “We have also future-proofed the regulation, the Commission will be able to react more quickly to new scientific findings on chemical substances,” said MEP Marion Walsmann (Germany/EPP), negotiator from the European Parliament.   The regulation introduces essential safety standard to ensure a high level of health and safety protection for children. It imposes a ban on chemicals that can cause cancer, alter DNA, or harm reproductive organs, but also other dangerous substances such as endocrine disruptors, respiratory sensitisers and PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals”.   It also bans skin sensitisers and toys treated with biocides, except for toys meant to stay outdoors. Biocidal products are used to protect people and animals against harmful organisms, like pests or bacteria.  The agreement further limits the use of preservatives and prohibits fragrance allergens in toys intended for children under three years old, or in toys meant to be placed in the mouth.  “Children's safety must always come first. While the EU's toy safety rules are among the strictest in the world, we must remain vigilant, adapt the rules to emerging risks and ensure that safety standards are met for all toys – whether made in Europe or abroad,” said Krzysztof Paszyk, Polish Minister for Economic Development and Technology in a press release after the agreement.  Before introducing a toy to the market, manufacturers will be required to carry out a safety assessment covering all potential risks, including chemical, physical, mechanical, electrical, flammability, hygiene and radioactivity hazards.  Walsmann noted that although the European market already offers “the safest toys in the world”, one in five products flagged as dangerous and withdrawn from the EU market is a toy.  “The PFAS restriction is a step forward in the fight against pollution from these forever chemicals. By restricting PFAS in toys, co-legislators have made the Toy Safety law future-proof and aligned with standards in other parts of the world,” said Ioana Bere, EU Policy advocate at CHEM Trust, an European charity that works to protect human health and the environment from harmful chemicals. A study by a Danish consumer organisation found that more than 60% of 121 children's products sampled including toys, blankets and feeding bottles contained or released at least one bisphenol – a chemical harmful for the brain and prostate gland of foetuses, infants and children. In many cases, two or more bisphenols were found.  “Toys are among the most reported product category in the EU’s alert system for dangerous products,” said Agustín Reyna, Director General of BEUC, a European consumers organisation.   He added that while the new rules are strong on paper, enforcement is key and member states must now provide the resources needed for authorities to ensure that only safe toys are sold.  BEUC’s recent study on the safety of toys sold in the Chinese online marketplace Temu concluded that the platform “is an entry point for dangerous products in Europe”.   To tackle this, the new rules introduce specific obligations for online sellers to comply with broader EU laws, including the Digital Services Act. All toys sold in the European market now need a digital product passport showing they meet safety standards. This, according to the legislators, will facilitate to track the products, improve checks by market inspectors and customs and increase transparency.  "

There was no room for any individual, including reservists on active duty, ""to exploit their military status while simultaneously participating in the fighting,"" an army official said in a statement, calling it a breach of trust between commanders and subordinates. The IDF said it decided that any active reservist who signed the letter would not be able to continue serving. It did not specify how many people were included or if the dismissals had already begun. Nearly 1,000 Israeli air force reservists and retirees signed a letter, published in domestic media on Thursday, demanding the immediate return of the hostages, even at the cost of ending the fighting. While the soldiers who signed the letter didn’t refuse to keep serving, it's part of a growing wave of Israeli service personnel speaking out against the 18-month conflict, with some saying they saw or did things that crossed ethical lines. ""It's completely illogical and irresponsible on behalf of the Israeli policy makers … risking the lives of the hostages, risking the lives of more soldiers and risking lives of many, many more innocent Palestinians, while it had a very clear alternative,"" retired Israeli Air Force pilot who spearheaded the letter Guy Poran said. Poran added that he was unaware whether anyone who signed the letter had been fired. Since the letter was published, it has gained dozens more signatures, according to him. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downplayed the letter on Friday, saying it was written by a ""small handful of weeds, operated by foreign-funded NGOs whose sole goal is to overthrow the right-wing government."" Anyone who encourages refusal will be immediately dismissed, Netanyahu explained. IDF soldiers are required to avoid politics and rarely speak out about the army or its operations. The letter comes as Israel ramps up its offensive in Gaza, trying to pressure Hamas to agree to free the remaining 59 hostages, more than half of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's blockade on food, fuel and humanitarian aid has left civilians in the Strip facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle. It has pledged to seize large parts of the Palestinian territory and establish a new security corridor cutting across it. After the Hamas incursion into Israel on 7 October 2023, Israel quickly united behind the war launched against the militant group. But divisions have grown as the war progressed, and most criticism has focused on the mounting number of soldiers killed and the failure to return the hostages. Freed hostages and their families are doing what they can to keep attention on their plight and urge the government to get the remaining captives back home. Meanwhile, the war against Hamas has shown no sign of stopping. Since Israel ended an eight-week ceasefire last month, it said it will push further into Gaza until Hamas releases the hostages. More than 1,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire collapsed in March, according to the United Nations. The IDF issued an urgent warning on Friday to residents in several neighbourhoods in northern Gaza, calling on them to evacuate immediately. Strikes earlier this week killed at least 23 people, health officials said, including eight women and eight children."

The group, once exclusively led by the US but now led by Germany and the UK, comprises 51 nations and partners.  German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius says today's announcement, including Germany's pledge of €11 billion until 2029, is a record boost in military funding for Ukraine.  The €21 billion also includes the UK's £4.5bn commitment for this year, which the country’s defence secretary John Healey described as its highest contribution yet. Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov warned Russia is ""ramping up [military] production"", and said Europe was now ""taking the lead in security assistance for which we are thankful to the UK and Europe"".  US Secretary of State Pete Hegseth participated online, and Umerov told reporters the US was continuing its military assistance to his country.  The lack of air defence capabilities remains a huge problem for Ukraine, as Russia has sent over 10,000 glide bombs into Ukraine since March, and 100 attack drones every day.  ""Air defence is a problem all over the world – we are doing as much as we can as fast as we can,"" said Pistorius. "
